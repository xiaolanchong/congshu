<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister
to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was
consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the
whole of that morning.  But her conclusion was false; for on
the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these
visitors came.  They had been walking about the place with some
of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to
dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the
sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a
gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street.
Elizabeth, immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it
meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her
relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected.  Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the
embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the
circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the
preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from
such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the
perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment
increasing.  She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but
amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the
partiality of the brother should have said too much in her
favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

西先生隔天就会带着她来拜访她，因此决定那<BR>
天整个上午都不离开旅馆，至多在附近走走。<BR>
可是她完全猜错了，原来她舅父母到达蓝白屯<BR>
的当天上午，那批客人就到了彭伯里。他们到<BR>
了蓝白屯的，便跟着几个新朋友到各处去溜达<BR>
了一转，刚刚回到旅馆去换衣服，以便到一家<BR>

对这件事有了一种新的看法。他们以前虽然完<BR>
全蒙在鼓里，没有看出达西先生爱上了他们的<BR>
外甥女儿，可是他们现在觉得一定是这么回事<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable
introduction took place.  With astonishment did Elizabeth see
that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as
herself.  Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss
Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few
minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.  She
found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a
monosyllable.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西兄妹终于走进了旅馆，大家郑重其事地介<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,
though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her
appearance womanly and graceful.  She was less handsome than
her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face,
and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and
unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西小姐身材很高，身段比伊丽莎白粗壮，她<BR>
虽然才十六岁，可是已经发育完全，一举一动<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">They had not been long together before Darcy told her that
Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time
to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor,
when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a
moment he entered the room.  All Elizabeth's anger against him
had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could
hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality
with which he expressed himself on seeing her again.  He
enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he
had ever done.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting
personage than to herself.  They had long wished to see him.
The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively
attention.  The suspicions which had just arisen, of Mr. Darcy
and their niece, directed their observation towards each with
an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least
knew what it was to love.  Of the lady's sensations they
remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was
overflowing with admiration was evident enough.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳夫妇也和她有同感，认为他是个耐人寻<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.  She wanted to
ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to
compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in
the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most
sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give
pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.  Bingley was ready,
Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined to be pleased.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;
and oh!  how ardently did she long to know whether any of his
were directed in a like manner.  Sometimes she could fancy that
he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice
pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he
was trying to trace a resemblance.  But though this might be
imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to
Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.  No look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.  Nothing
occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his
sister.  On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three
little circumstances occurred ere they parted which, in her
anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not
untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might
lead to the mention of her, had he dared.  He observed to her,
at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a
tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very
long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her -- " and,
before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months.
We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all
dancing together at Netherfield."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">看到了彬格莱，她一切的念头自然都转到自己<BR>
姐姐身上去了，她多么想要知道他是不是也同<BR>
她一样，会想到她姐姐！她有时觉得他比从前<BR>
说话说得少了。不过有一两次，当他看着她的<BR>
时候，她又觉得他竭力想在她身上看出一点和<BR>
姐姐相似的地方。这也许是她自己的凭空假想<BR>
，不过有一件事她可看得很真切：人家都说达<BR>
西小姐是吉英的情敌，其实彬格莱先生对达西<BR>
小姐并没有什么情意。他们两人之间看不出有<BR>
什么特别钟情的地方。无论什么地方，都不能<BR>
证明彬格莱小姐的愿望一定会实现。伊丽莎白<BR>
立刻就觉得自己这种想法颇近情理。宾客们临<BR>
走以前，又发生了两三件小事，伊丽莎白因为<BR>
爱姐心切，便认为为两三件小事足以说明彬格<BR>
莱先生对吉英依然旧情难忘，而且他还想多攀<BR>
谈一会儿，以便谈到吉英身上去，只可惜他胆<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he
afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any
of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn.  There
was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but
there was a look and manner which gave them meaning.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白见他对往事记得这么清楚，很是高兴<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy
himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an
expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she
heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his
companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners
which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its
existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.  When she
saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good
opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago
would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not
only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly
disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford
Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck
so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her
astonishment from being visible.  Never, even in the company of
his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at
Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no
importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and
when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were
addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the
ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.

想道：昨天亲眼看到他作风大有改进，那即使<BR>
是一时的改变，至少也保持到了今天。几个月<BR>
以前他认为和这些人打交道有失身份，如今他<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour, and when
they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join
him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner
and Miss Bennet to dinner at Pemberley before they left the
country.  Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked
her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how
<I>she</I>, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to
its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.
Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather
a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal,
and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect
willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her
attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and
many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.
Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak
of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as
some others, found herself, when their visitors left them,
capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it
had been little.  Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries
or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long
enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then
hurried away to dress.

It was evident that she was much better acquainted with

but nothing to justify enquiry.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,
as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to
find.  They could not be untouched by his politeness, and, had
they drawn his character from their own feelings and his
servant's report, without any reference to any other account,
the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not
have recognised it for Mr. Darcy.  There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became
sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him
since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated
respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.  Neither had
any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends
that could materially lessen its weight.  They had nothing to
accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it
would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town where the family did not visit.  It was
acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much
good among the poor.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening
more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it
seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings
towards <I>one</I> in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole
hours endeavouring to make them out.  She certainly did not
hate him.  No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost
as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that
could be so called.  The respect created by the conviction of
his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted,
had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and
it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by
the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward
his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had
produced.  But above all, above respect and esteem, there was
a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked.
It was gratitude. -- Gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all
the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and
all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.  He who,
she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy,
seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the
acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or
any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were
concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and
bent on making her known to his sister.  Such a change in a man
of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude --
for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such,
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no
means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.  She
respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him; she felt a
real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far
it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ
the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of
bringing on the renewal of his addresses.

谦虚，这不仅叫人惊奇，也叫人感激，这不能<BR>
不归根于爱情，浓烈的爱情。她虽然不能千真<BR>
万确地把这种爱情说出一个所以然来，可是她<BR>
决不觉得讨厌，而且还深深地给打动了心，觉<BR>
得应该让这种爱情滋长下去。她既然尊敬他，<BR>
器重他，感激他，便免不了极其关心到他幸福<BR>
；她相信自己依旧有本领叫他再来求婚，问题<BR>
只在于她是否应该放心大胆地施展出这副本领<BR>
，以便达到双方的幸福。<BR></TD>

that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to
them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley -- for she had
reached it only to a late breakfast -- ought to be imitated,
though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness
on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly
expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.
They were, therefore, to go. -- Elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say
in reply.
