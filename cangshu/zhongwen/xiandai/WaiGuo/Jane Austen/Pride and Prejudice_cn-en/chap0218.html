<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The first week of their return was soon gone.  The second
began.  It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and
all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.
The dejection was almost universal.  The elder Miss Bennets
alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the
usual course of their employments.  Very frequently were they
reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own
misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她们回得家来，眨下眼睛就过了一个星期，现<BR>

年轻小姐们立刻一个个垂头丧气起来。几乎处<BR>
处都是心灰意冷的气象。只有班纳特家的两位<BR>
大小姐照常饮食起居，照常各干各的事。可是<BR>
吉蒂和丽迪雅已经伤心到极点，便不由得常常<BR>
责备两位姐姐冷淡无情。她们真不明白，家里<BR>
怎么竟会有这样没有心肝的人！<BR></TD>

Colonel Millar's regiment went away.  I thought I should have
broke my heart."

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually
through Longbourn-house.  Elizabeth tried to be diverted by
them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.  She felt
anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she
before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the
views of his friend.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">浪搏恩这家人家的两位小姐，就是这样没完没<BR>
结地长吁短叹。伊丽莎白想把她们笑话一番，<BR>
可是羞耻心打消了她一切的情趣。她重新又想<BR>
到达西先生的确没有冤枉她们，他指出她们的<BR>
那些缺陷确是事实，她深深感觉到，实在难怪<BR>
他要干涉他朋友和吉英的好事。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away;
for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of
the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.
This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately
married.  A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had
recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their
<I>three</I> months' acquaintance they had been intimate <I>two</I>.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">但是丽迪雅的忧郁不多一会就烟消云散，因为<BR>
弗斯脱团长的太太请她陪她一块儿到白利屯去<BR>
。这位贵友是位很年轻的夫人新近才结婚的。<BR>
她跟丽迪雅都是好兴致，好精神，因此意气相<BR>
投：虽然才只三个月的友谊，却已经做了两个<BR>
月的知已。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of
Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification
of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.  Wholly inattentive to
her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless
ecstacy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing
and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless
Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as
unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">丽迪雅这时候是怎样欢天喜地，她对于弗斯脱<BR>
太太是怎样敬慕，班纳特太太又是怎样高兴，<BR>
吉蒂又是怎样难受，这些自然不在话下。在屋<BR>
子里跳来蹦去，叫大家都来祝贺她，大笑大叫<BR>
，比往常闹得越发厉害；倒运的吉蒂却只能继<BR>
续在小客厅里怨天尤命，怪三怪四。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask <I>me</I> as well as
Lydia," said she, "though I am <I>not</I> her particular friend.
I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too,
for I am two years older."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我不明白弗斯脱太太为什么不叫我和丽迪雅<BR>
一同去，”她说，“即使我不是她特别要好的<BR>
朋友，又何妨也邀我一同去。照说我比她大两<BR>
岁，面子也得大些呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In vain did Elizabeth attempt to reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned.  As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so
far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and
Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all
possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as
such a step must make her were it known, she could not help
secretly advising her father not to let her go.  She
represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the
friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability
of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at
Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.
He heard her attentively, and then said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白把道理讲给她听，吉英也劝她不必生<BR>
气，她都不理睬。再说伊丽莎白，她对于这次<BR>
邀请，完全不象她母亲和丽迪雅那样兴高采烈<BR>
，她只觉得丽迪雅纵然还没有糊涂到那种地步<BR>
，这一去可算完全给毁了。于是她只得暗地里<BR>
叫她父亲不许丽迪雅去，也顾不得事后让丽迪<BR>
雅知道了，会把她恨到什么地步。她把丽迪雅<BR>
日常行为举止失检的地方，都告诉了父亲，说<BR>
明和弗斯脱太太这样一个女人做朋友毫无益处<BR>
，跟这样的一个朋友到白利屯去，也许会变得<BR>
更荒唐，因为那边的诱惑力一定比这里大。父<BR>
亲用心听她把话讲完，然后说道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some
public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it
with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under
the present circumstances."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“丽迪雅非到公共场所之类的地方去出一出丑<BR>
，是决不肯罢休的。她这次要去出丑，既不必<BR>
花家里的钱，又用不着家里麻烦，真难得有这<BR>
样的机会呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great
disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice
of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has
already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently
in the affair."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白说：“丽迪雅那样轻浮冒失，一定会<BR>
引起外人注目，会使我们姐妹吃她的大亏──<BR>
事实上已经吃了很大的亏──你要是想到了这<BR>
一点，那你对这桩事的看法就会两样了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Already arisen!" repeated Mr. Bennet.  "What, has she
frightened away some of your lovers?  Poor little Lizzy!  But
do not be cast down.  Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to
be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been
kept aloof by Lydia's folly."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“已经使你们吃了大亏！”班纳特先生重复了<BR>
一遍。“这话怎么说：她把你们的爱人吓跑了<BR>
不成？可怜的小丽萃呀，甭担心。那些经不起<BR>
一点儿小风浪的挑三剔四的小伙子。因为看见<BR>
了丽迪雅的放荡行为，而不敢向你们问津？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Indeed you are mistaken.  I have no such injuries to resent,
It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now
complaining.  Our importance, our respectability in the world,
must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and
disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character.  Excuse
me -- for I must speak plainly.  If you, my dear father, will
not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of
teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the
business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of
amendment.  Her character will be fixed, and she will, at
sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself
and her family ridiculous.  A flirt, too, in the worst and
meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and
emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of
that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will
excite.  In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.  She will
follow wherever Lydia leads. -- Vain, ignorant, idle, and
absolutely uncontrolled!  Oh!  my dear father, can you suppose
it possible that they will not be censured and despised
wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be
often involved in the disgrace?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你完全弄错了我的意思。我并不是因为吃了<BR>
亏才来埋怨。我也说不出我究竟是在埋怨哪一<BR>
种害处，只觉得害处很多。丽迪雅这种放荡不<BR>
羁、无法无天的性格，确实对我们体面攸关，<BR>
一定会影响到我们的社会地位。我说话爽直，<BR>
千万要请你原谅。好爸爸，你得想办法管教管<BR>
教她这种撒野的脾气，叫她明白，不能够一辈<BR>
子都这样到处追逐，否则她马上就要无可救药<BR>
了。一旦她的性格定型以后，就难得改过来。<BR>
她才不过十六岁，就成了一个十足的浪荡女子<BR>
，弄得她自己和家庭都惹人笑话，而且她还轻<BR>
佻浪荡到极端下贱无耻的地步。她只不过年纪<BR>
还轻，略有几分姿色，此外就一无可取。她愚<BR>
昧无知，头脑糊涂，只知道搏得别人爱慕，结<BR>
果到处叫人看不起。吉蒂也有这种危险。丽迪<BR>
雅要她东就东，西就西。她既无知，又爱虚荣<BR>
，生性又懒惰，完全是没有一点家教的样子！<BR>
哎哟，我的好爸爸呀，她们随便走到什么地方<BR>
，只要有人认识她们，她们就会受人指责，受<BR>
人轻视，还时常连累到她们的姐姐们也丢脸，<BR>
难道你还以为不会这样吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject;
and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特先生看到她钻进了牛角尖，便慈祥地握<BR>
住她扔手说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.  Wherever you and Jane
are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not
appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or I may
say, three -- very silly sisters.  We shall have no peace at
Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.  Let her go then.
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any
real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of
prey to any body.  At Brighton she will be of less importance,
even as a common flirt, than she has been here.  The officers
will find women better worth their notice.  Let us hope,
therefore, that her being there may teach her her own
insignificance.  At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees
worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her
life."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“好孩子，放心好了。你和吉英两个人，随便<BR>
走到什么有熟人的地方，人家都会尊敬你们，<BR>
器生你们；你们决不会因为有了两个──甚至<BR>
三个傻妹妹，就失掉了体面。这次要是不让丽<BR>
迪雅到白利屯去，我们在浪搏恩就休想安静。<BR>
还是让她去吧。弗斯脱上校是个有见识的人，<BR>
不会让她闯出什么祸事来的；幸亏她又太穷，<BR>
谁也不会看中她。白利屯跟这儿的情形两样，<BR>
她即使去做一个普通的浪荡女子，也不够资格<BR>
。军官们会找到更中意的对象。因此，我们但<BR>
愿她到了那儿以后，可以得到些教训，知道她<BR>
自己没有什么了不起。无论如何，她再坏也坏<BR>
不到哪里去，我们总不能把她一辈子关在家里<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her
own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed
and sorry.  It was not in her nature, however, to increase her
vexations by dwelling on them.  She was confident of having
performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or
augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白听到父亲这样回答，虽然并没有因此<BR>
改变主张，却也只得表示满意，闷闷不乐地走<BR>
开了。以她那样性格的人，也不会尽想着这些<BR>
事自寻烦恼。她相信她已经尽了自己的责任，<BR>
至于要她为那些无法避免的害处去忧闷，或者<BR>
是过分焦虑，那她可办不到。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference
with her father, their indignation would hardly have found
expression in their united volubility.  In Lydia's imagination,
a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly
happiness.  She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the
streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.  She
saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of
them at present unknown.  She saw all the glories of the camp;
its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines,
crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet;
and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a
tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">倘若丽迪雅和她母亲知道她这次跟父亲谈话的<BR>
内容，她们一定要气死了，即使她们两张利嘴<BR>
同时夹攻，滔滔不绝地大骂一阵，也还消不了<BR>
她们的气。在丽迪雅的想象中，只要到白利屯<BR>
去一次，人间天上的幸福都会获得。她幻想着<BR>
在那华丽的浴场附近，一条条街道上都挤满了<BR>
军官。她幻想着几十个甚至几百个素昧生平的<BR>
军官，都对她献殷勤。她幻想着堂皇富丽的营<BR>
帐，帐幕整洁美观，里面挤满了血气方刚的青<BR>
年小伙子，都穿着灿烂夺目的大红军服。她还<BR>
幻想到一幅最美满的情景，幻想到自己坐在一<BR>
个帐篷里面，同时跟好多个军官在柔情密意地<BR>
卖弄风情。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such
prospects and such realities as these, what would have been
her sensations?  They could have been understood only by her
mother, who might have felt nearly the same.  Lydia's going
to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy
conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">倘若她知道了她姐姐竟要妨害她，不让她去享<BR>
受到这些美妙的远景和美妙的现实，那叫她怎<BR>
么受得了？只有她母亲才能体谅她这种心境，<BR>
而且几乎和她有同感。她相信丈夫决不打算到<BR>
白利屯去，她感到很痛苦，因此，丽迪雅能够<BR>
去一次，对她这种痛苦实在是莫大的安慰。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their
raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day
of Lydia's leaving home.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">可是她们母女俩完全不知道这回事，因此，到<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.  Having
been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation
was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality
entirely so.  She had even learnt to detect, in the very
gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a
sameness to disgust and weary.  In his present behaviour to
herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for
the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions
which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could
only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.  She
lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as
the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she
steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained
in his believing that, however long, and for whatever cause,
his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be
gratified and her preference secured at any time by their
renewal.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">现在轮到伊丽莎白和韦翰先生最后一次会面了<BR>
。她自从回家以后，已经见过他不少次，因此<BR>
不安的情绪早就消失了；她曾经为了从前对他<BR>

得无影无踪。他以前曾以风度文雅而搏得过她<BR>
的欢心，现在她看出了这里面的虚伪做作，陈<BR>
腔滥调，觉得十分厌恶。他目前对待她的态度<BR>
，又造成了她不愉快的一个新的根源；他不久<BR>
就流露出要跟她重温旧好的意思，殊不知经过<BR>
了那一番冷暖之后，却只会使她生气。她发觉<BR>
要跟她谈情说爱的这个人，竟是一个游手好闲<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he
dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little
was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on
his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had
passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and
Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked
him if he were acquainted with the former.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">民团离开麦里屯的前一天，他跟别的一些军官<BR>

off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the
gentlest of accents,

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will
readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise
enough to assume even the <I>appearance</I> of what is right.  His
pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself,
to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct
as I have suffered by.  I only fear that the sort of
cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is
merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion
and judgment he stands much in awe.  His fear of her has always
operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is
to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De
Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."

那种骄傲即使对他自己没有什么益处，对别人<BR>
也许倒有好处，因为他既有这种骄傲，就不会<BR>

只怕他虽然收敛了一些（你大概就是说他比较<BR>
收敛了一些吧）事实上只不过为了要在他姨母<BR>
面前做幌子，让他姨母看得起他，说他的好话<BR>
。我很明白，每逢他和他姨母在一起的时候，<BR>
他就免不了战战兢兢，这多半是为了想和德・<BR>

only by a slight inclination of the head.  She saw that he
wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and
she was in no humour to indulge him.  The rest of the evening
passed with the <I>appearance</I>, on his side, of usual
cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and
possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.

Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next
morning.  The separation between her and her family was rather
noisy than pathetic.  Kitty was the only one who shed tears;
but she did weep from vexation and envy.  Mrs. Bennet was
diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice,
which there was every reason to believe would be attended to;
and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding
farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered
without being heard.
