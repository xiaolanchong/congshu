<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing
to Jane, while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business
into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door,
the certain signal of a visitor.  As she had heard no carriage,
she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under
that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter
that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door
opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">第二天早晨，柯林斯太太和玛丽亚到村里有事<BR>
去了，伊丽莎白独自坐在家里写信给吉英，这<BR>
时候，她突然吓了一跳，因为门铃响了起来，<BR>
准是有客人来了。她并没有听到马车声，心想<BR>
，可能是咖苔琳夫人来了，于是她就疑虑不安<BR>
地把那封写好一半的信放在一旁，免得她问些<BR>
卤莽的话。就在这当儿，门开了，她大吃一惊<BR>
，万万想不到走进来的是达西先生，而且只有<BR>
达西一个人。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised
for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood
all the ladies to be within.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西看见她单独一人，也显得很吃惊，连忙道<BR>
歉说，他原以为太太小姐们全没有，出去，所<BR>
以才冒昧闯进来。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were
made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.  It was
absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in
this emergency recollecting when she had seen him last in
Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on
the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他们俩坐了下来，她向他问了几句关于罗新斯<BR>
的情形以后，双方便好象都无话可说，大有陷<BR>
于僵局的危险。因此，非得想点儿什么说说不<BR>
可；正当这紧张关头，她想起了上次在哈福德<BR>
郡跟他见面的情况，顿时便起了一阵好奇心，<BR>
想要听听他对那次匆匆的离别究竟有些什么意<BR>
见，于是她便说道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November,
Mr. Darcy!  It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.
Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect
right, he went but the day before.  He and his sisters were
well, I hope, when you left London."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“去年十一月你们离开尼日斐花园多么突然呀<BR>
，达西先生！彬格莱先生看见你们大家一下子<BR>
都跟着他走，一定相当惊奇吧；我好象记得他<BR>
比你们只早走一天。我想，当你离开伦敦的时<BR>
候，他和他的姐妹们一定身体都很好吧？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Perfectly so -- I thank you."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“好极了，谢谢你。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She found that she was to receive no other answer -- and, after
a short pause, added,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她发觉对方没有别的话再回答她了，隔了一会<BR>
儿便又说道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea
of ever returning to Netherfield again?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我想，彬攻莱先生大概不打算再回到尼日斐<BR>
花园来了吧？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may
spend very little of his time there in future.  He has many
friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and
engagements are continually increasing."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我从来没有听到他这么说过；不过，可能他<BR>
不打算在那儿久住。他有很多朋友，象他这样<BR>
年龄的人，交际应酬当然一天比一天多。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be
better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place
entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family
there.  But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much
for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we
must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“如果他不打算在尼日斐花园久住，那么，为<BR>
了街坊四邻着想，他最好干脆退租，让我们可<BR>
以得到一个固定的邻居，不过彬格莱先生租那<BR>
幢房子，说不定只是为了他自己方便，并没有<BR>
顾念到邻舍，我看他那幢房子无论是保留也好<BR>
，退租也好，他的原则都是一样。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it
up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西先生说：“我料定他一旦买到了合适的房<BR>
子，马上会退租。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth made no answer.  She was afraid of talking longer of
his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined
to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白没有回答。她唯恐再谈到他那位朋友<BR>
身上去；既然没有别的话可说，她便决定让他<BR>
动动脑筋，另外找个话题来谈。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very
comfortable house.  Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal
to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他领会了她的用意，隔了一忽儿便说道：“柯<BR>
林斯先生这所房子倒好象很舒适呢。我相信他<BR>
初到汉斯福的时候，咖苔琳夫人一定在这上面<BR>
费了好大一番心思吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I believe she did -- and I am sure she could not have bestowed
her kindness on a more grateful object."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我也相信她费了一番心思，而且我敢说，她<BR>
的好心并没有白费，因为天下再也找不出一个<BR>
比他更懂得感恩报德的人了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“柯林斯先生娶到了这样一位太太真是福气。<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met
with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted
him, or have made him happy if they had.  My friend has an
excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I
consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever
did.  She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential
light, it is certainly a very good match for her."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“是呀，的确是福气；他的朋友们应当为他高<BR>
兴，难得有这样一个头脑清楚的女人肯嫁给他<BR>
，嫁了他又能使他幸福，我这个女朋友是个绝<BR>
顶聪明的人，不过她跟柯林斯先生结婚，我可<BR>
不认为是上策。她倒好象极其幸福，而且，用<BR>
普通人的眼光来看，她这门婚姻当然攀得很好<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy
a distance of her own family and friends."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“她离开娘家和朋友都这么近，这一定会使她<BR>
很满意的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"An easy distance do you call it?  It is nearly fifty miles."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你说很近吗？快五十英里呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And what is fifty miles of good road?  Little more than half a
day's journey.  Yes, I call it a <I>very</I> easy distance."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“只要道路方便，五十英里能算远吗？只消大<BR>
半天就到得了我认为很近。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I should never have considered the distance as one of the
<I>advantages</I> of the match," cried Elizabeth.  "I should never
have said Mrs. Collins was settled <I>near</I> her family."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白嚷道：“我从来没有认为道路的远近<BR>
，也成了这门婚姻的有利条件之一，我决不会<BR>
说柯林斯太太住得离家很近。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn,
I suppose, would appear far."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这说明你自己太留恋哈福德郡。我看你只要<BR>
走出浪搏恩一步，就会嫌远。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied
she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane
and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他说这话的时候，不禁一笑，伊丽莎白觉得自<BR>
己俯他这一笑的深意：他一定以为她想起了吉<BR>
英和尼日斐花园吧，于是她红了脸回答道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near
her family.  The far and the near must be relative, and depend
on many varying circumstances.  Where there is fortune to make
the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no
evil.  But that is not the case <I>here</I>.  Mr. and Mrs. Collins
have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of
frequent journeys -- and I am persuaded my friend would not
call herself <I>near</I> her family under less than <I>half</I> the
present distance."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我并不是说，一个女人家就不许嫁得离娘家<BR>
太近。远近是相对的，还得看各种不同的情况<BR>
来决定。只要你出得起盘缠，远一些又何妨。<BR>
这儿的情形却不是这样。柯林斯夫妇虽然收入<BR>
还好，可也经不起经常旅行；即使把目前的距<BR>
离缩短到一小半，我相信我的朋友也不会以为<BR>
离娘家近的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said,
"<I>You</I> cannot have a right to such very strong local
attachment.  <I>You</I> cannot have been always at Longbourn."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西先生把椅子移近她一些，说道：“你可不<BR>
能有这么重的乡士观念。你总不能一辈子待在<BR>
浪搏恩呀。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth looked surprised.  The gentleman experienced some
change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper
from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白有些神色诧异。达西也觉得心情有些<BR>
两样，便把椅子拖后一点，从桌子上拿起一张<BR>
报纸看了一眼，用一种比较冷静的声音说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Are you pleased with Kent?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你喜欢肯特吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on
either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the
entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their
walk.  The tete-a-tete surprised them.  Mr. Darcy related
the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet,
and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to
any body, went away.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">于是他们俩把这个村庄短短地谈论了几句，彼<BR>
此都很冷静，措辞也颇简洁。一会儿工夫，夏<BR>
绿蒂跟她妹妹散步回来了，谈话就此终止。夏<BR>
绿蒂姐妹俩看到他们促膝谈心，都觉得诧异。<BR>
达西先生把他方才误闯进来遇见班纳特小姐的<BR>
原委说了一遍，然后稍许坐了几分钟就走了，<BR>
跟谁也没有多谈。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon
as he was gone.  "My dear Eliza he must be in love with you,
or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他走了以后，夏绿蒂说；“这是什么意思？亲<BR>
爱的伊丽莎，他一定爱上你啦，否则他决不会<BR>
这样随随便便来看我们的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very
likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after
various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit
to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do,
which was the more probable from the time of year.  All field
sports were over.  Within doors there was Lady Catherine,
books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always
within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in
it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of
walking thither almost every day.  They called at various times
of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and
now and then accompanied by their aunt.  It was plain to them
all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in
their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him
still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction
in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her,
of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in
comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the
best informed mind.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白把他刚才那种说不出话的情形告诉了<BR>
她，夏绿蒂便觉得自己纵有这番好意，看上去<BR>
又不象是这么回事。她们东猜西猜，结果只有<BR>
认为他这次是因为闲来无聊，所以才出来探亲<BR>
访友，这种说法倒还算讲得过去，因为到了这<BR>
个季节，一切野外的活动都过时了，待在家里<BR>
虽然可以和咖苔琳夫人谈谈，看看书，还可以<BR>
打打弹子，可是男人们总不能一直不出房门；<BR>
既然牧师住宅相隔很近，顺便散散步荡到那儿<BR>
去玩玩，也很愉快，况且那家人又很有趣昧，<BR>
于是两位表兄弟在这段作客时期，差不多每天<BR>
都禁不住要上那儿去走一趟。他们总是上午去<BR>
，迟早没有一定，有时候分头去，有时候同道<BR>
去，间或姨母也跟他们一起去。女眷们看得非<BR>
常明白，费茨威廉来访，是因为他喜欢跟她们<BR>
在一起──这当然使人家愈加喜欢他，伊丽莎<BR>
白跟他在一起就觉得很满意，他显然也爱慕伊<BR>
丽莎白，这两重情况使伊丽莎白想起了她以前<BR>
的心上人乔治・韦翰；虽说把这两个人比较起<BR>
来，她觉得费茨威廉的风度没有韦翰那么温柔<BR>
迷人，然而她相信他脑子里的花样更多。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more
difficult to understand.  It could not be for society, as he
frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his
lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity
rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety, not a
pleasure to himself.  He seldom appeared really animated.
Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him.  Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved
that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him
could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe
this change the effect of love, and the object of that love,
her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it
out. -- She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and
whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.  He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression
of that look was disputable.  It was an earnest, steadfast
gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration
in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">可是达西先生为什么常到牧师家昊来，这仍然<BR>
叫人不容易明白。他不可能是为了要热闹，因<BR>
为他老是在那儿坐上十分钟一句话也不说，说<BR>
起话来也好象是迫不得已的样子，而不是真有<BR>
什么话要说──好象是在礼貌上委曲求全，而<BR>
不是出于内心的高兴。他很少有真正兴高采烈<BR>
的时候。柯林斯太太简直弄他不懂。费茨威廉<BR>
有时候笑他呆头呆脑，可见他平常并不是这样<BR>
，柯林斯太太当然弄不清其中的底蕴。她但愿<BR>
他这种变化是恋爱所造成的，而且恋爱的对象<BR>
就是她朋友伊丽莎，于是她一本正经地动起脑<BR>
筋来，要把这件事弄个明白。每当她们去罗新<BR>
斯的时候，每当他来到汉斯福的时候，她总是<BR>
注意着他，可是毫无效果。他的确常常望着她<BR>
的朋友，可是他那种目光究竟深意何在，还值<BR>
得商榷。他痴呆呆地望着她，的确很诚恳，可<BR>
是柯林斯太太还是不敢断定他的目光里面究竟<BR>
含有多少爱慕的情意，而且有时候那种目光简<BR>
直是完全心不在焉的样子。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of
his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the
idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the
subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might
only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not
of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she
could suppose him to be in her power.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她曾经有一两次向伊丽莎白提示过，说他可能<BR>
倾心于她，可是伊丽莎白老是一笑置之；柯林<BR>
斯太太觉得不应该尽在这个问题上唠叨不休，<BR>
不要撩得人家动了心，到头来却只落得一个失<BR>
望；照她的看法，只要伊丽莎白自己觉得已经<BR>
把他抓在手里，那么，毫无问题，一切厌恶他<BR>
的情绪自然都会消失的。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her
marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.  He was beyond comparison the
pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in
life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these
advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church,
and his cousin could have none at all.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她好心好意处处为伊丽莎白打算，有时候也打<BR>
算把她嫁给费茨威廉，他真是个最有风趣的人<BR>
，任何人也比不上他；他当然也爱慕她，他的<BR>
社会地位又是再适当也没有了；不过，达西先<BR>
生在教会里不很大的权力，而他那位表兄弟却<BR>
根本没有，相形之下，表兄弟这些优点就无足<BR>
轻重了。<BR></TD>
