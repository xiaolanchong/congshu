Upper-Intermediate - Complaining About The Boss

(D0743)

A

王经理今天叫你去干吗？

Wáng jīnglǐ jīntiān jiào nǐ qù gànmá?

What did Manager Wang make you do today?

B

别提了，把我臭骂一顿。说我上班时间成天挂在msn、qq上。他自己不也是？否则怎么知道我在上面？

bié tí le, bǎ wǒ chòumà yī dùn. shuō wǒ shàngbān shíjiān chéngtiān guà zài MSN, QQ shàng. tā zìjǐ bù yě shì? fǒuzé zěnme zhīdào wǒ zài shàngmian?

Don't ask.  He reemed me out.  He said all my work time is spent on MSN and QQ.  Isn't he the same?  Otherwise how would he know I'm on it?

A

这个马屁精，看见这两天总公司有人来，就成天找我们麻烦。

zhège mǎpìjīng, kànjiàn zhè liǎng tiān zǒnggōngsī yǒurén lái, jiù chéngtiān zhǎo wǒmen máfan.

That brown noser, the past couple days he saw there was someone from head office here, so all day long kept trying to give us trouble.

B

就是，平时自己没一天准时到。这两天恨不得天不亮就来。真会演戏！

jiùshì, píngshí zìjǐ méi yī tiān zhǔnshí dào. zhè liǎng tiān hènbude tiān bù liàng jiù lái. zhēn huì yǎnxì!

Exactly.  Ordinarily he himself never arrives on time.  The past couple days he's itching to get here before the sun is even up.  He really knows how to put on a show.

A

两面派。听说他还经常打小报告呢。连公司里谁谈恋爱他都要向老板汇报。真是小人。

liǎngmiànpài. tīngshuō tā hái jīngcháng dǎxiǎobàogào ne. lián gōngsī lǐ shéi tán liàn ài tā dōu yào xiàng lǎobǎn huìbào. zhēnshì xiǎorén.

Two-faced.  I've heard that he also often rats on his colleagues.  He even goes and reports to the boss about who in the company is dating.  He's really a scoundrel.

B

他只会搞这一套。别的什么本事也没有。都是靠这个一路爬上去的。

tā zhǐ huì gǎo zhè yītào. biéde shénme běnshì yě méiyǒu. dōu shì kào zhège yīlù pá shàngqù de.

He's just a big phony.  He doesn't have any other kind of ability.  He relies on that to get ahead.

A

还有剥削我们。一个星期不叫我们加班就浑身不舒服。而且连晚饭、交通都不补贴。

háiyǒu bōxuē wǒmen. yī ge xīngqī bù jiào wǒmen jiābān jiù húnshēn bù shūfu. érqiě lián wǎnfàn, jiāotōng dōu bù bǔtiē.

And he exploits us.  If he doesn't make us work overtime in a week he just doesn't feel right.  Plus he doesn't even subsidize our transportation and dinner expenses.

B

晚饭现在有补贴了。五块钱。真是笑掉大牙！五块，叫我们喝西北风啊？

wǎnfàn xiànzài yǒu bǔtiē le. wǔ kuàiqián. zhēnshì xiàodiàodàyá! wǔkuài, jiào wǒmen hē xīběifēng a?

Dinner expenses are subsidized now.  Five RMB.  It makes me laugh my head off.  Five RMB, we'd die from hunger.

A

就是，他怎么做得出来？你看公司员工哪一个不恨他？老板真是瞎眼了，叫这种人做经理。他有什么管理才能？

jiùshì, tā zěnme zuò de chūlái? nǐ kàn gōngsī yuángōng nǎ yī ge bù hèn tā? lǎobǎn zhēnshì xiāyǎn le, jiào zhèzhǒng rén zuò jīnglǐ. tā yǒu shénme guǎnlǐ cáinéng?

Exactly.  How can he do that?  You tell me which employee doesn't hate him?  The boss is really blind, to get this kind of person to be our manager.  What kind of management abilities does he have?

B

啊哟，老板最喜欢他这种人。叫员工卖命、帮公司省钱。完全就是一个太监！

āyō, lǎobǎn zuì xǐhuan tā zhèzhǒng rén. jiào yuángōng màimìng, bāng gōngsī shěngqián. wánquán jiùshì yī ge tàijiàn!

Yikes, the boss likes that kind of person the best.  Working the employees to death helps the company save money.  He's a complete eunuch.

A

哈，你也这么觉得啊？我们背地里都叫他王公公！

hā, nǐ yě zhème juéde a? wǒmen bèidìli dōu jiào tā Wáng gōnggong!

Hah!  You feel this way too?  We all call him Wang Gonggong behind his back!

B

像的、像的！

xiàng de, xiàng de!

Exactly!  Exactly!

A

我告诉你他多可恶。那天跟我说，“小刘，你最近加班很忙，找你开会都没时间。你周末到公司来，我们开个会。”我当时简直想把他的头扭下来。

wǒ gàosu nǐ tā duō kěwù. nà tiān gēn wǒ shuō, "Xiǎo Liú, nǐ zuìjìn jiābān hěn máng, zhǎo nǐ kāihuì dōu méi shíjiān. nǐ zhōumò dào gōngsī lái, wǒmen kāi ge huì. "wǒ dāngshí jiǎnzhí xiǎng bǎ tā de tóu niǔ xiàlai.

I'm telling you, he is really abominable.  The other day he said to me "Xiao Liu, lately you've been really busy working overtime, there's no time to have a meeting with you.  Come into the office on the weekend, and we'll have a meeting."  When he said that I wanted to simply twist his head off.

B

你去了？

nǐ qù le?

Did you go?

A

不去怎么办？他的眼神明显在说：“你不来，有的是人要来。”

bù qù zěnme bàn? tā de yǎnshén míngxiǎn zài shuō: "nǐ bù lái, yǒude shì rén yào lái. "

If I didn't go what would happen.  The look in his eye was very clear: "If you don't come, there's no lack of people that are willing to come."

B

哎，我们怎么会碰到这种变态的经理！

āi, wǒmen zěnme huì pèngdào zhèzhǒng biàntài de jīnglǐ!

(Sigh) How could we end up with this kind of a weirdo for a manager?

A

还好他只是我们的经理。你想，做他的老婆、孩子不倒霉死了！

hái hǎo tā zhǐshì wǒmen de jīnglǐ. nǐ xiǎng, zuò tā de lǎopó, háizi bù dǎoméi sǐ le!

Good thing he's just our manager.  Imagine being his wife or kids... they're the really unlucky ones!
