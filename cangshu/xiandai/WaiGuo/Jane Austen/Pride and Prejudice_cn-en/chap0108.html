At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past
six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.  To the civil inquiries
which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure
of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's,
she could not make a very favourable answer.  Jane was by no
means better.  The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four
times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have
a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill
themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them
restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
五点钟的时候，主人家两姐妹出去更衣；六点<br>
半的时候伊丽莎白被请去吃晚饭。大家都礼貌<br>
周全，纷纷来探问吉英的病情，其中尤其是彬<br>
格莱先生问得特别关切，这叫伊丽莎白非常愉<br>
快，只可惜吉英的病情一些没有好转，因此她<br>
无法给人家满意的回答。那姐妹听到这话，便<br>
几次三番地说她们是多么担心，说重伤风是多<br>
么可怕，又说她们自己多么讨厌生病，──说<br>
过了这些话以后就不当它一回事了。伊丽莎白<br>
看到她们当吉英不在她们面前的时候就对吉英<br>
这般冷淡，于是她本来那种讨厌她们的心理现<br>
在又重新滋长起来。
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she
could regard with any complacency.  His anxiety for Jane was
evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and
they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she
believed she was considered by the others.  She had very little
notice from any but him.  Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.
Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by
whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer
a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
的确，她们这家人里面只有她们的兄弟能使她<br>
称心满意，你一眼便可以看出他是真的在为吉<br>
英担忧，再说他对于伊丽莎白也殷勤和悦到极<br>
点。伊丽莎白本以为人家会把她看作一个不速<br>
之客，可是有了这份殷勤，她就不这么想了。<br>
除他以外，别人都不大理睬她。彬格莱小姐的<br>
心在达西先生身上，赫斯脱太太差不多也没有<br>
什么两样；再说到赫斯脱先生，他就坐在伊丽<br>
莎白身旁，他天生一副懒骨头，活在世上就是<br>
为了吃、喝、玩牌，他听到伊丽莎白宁可吃一<br>
碟普通的菜而不喜欢吃烩肉，便和她谈不上劲<br>
了。

When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss
Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture
of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no
beauty.  Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
伊丽莎白一吃过晚饭就回到吉英那儿去。她一<br>
走出饭厅，彬格莱小姐就开始说她的坏话，把<br>
她的作风说得坏透了，说她既傲慢又无礼貌，<br>
不懂得跟人家攀谈，仪表不佳，风趣索然，人<br>
又长得难看。赫斯脱太太也是同样的看法，而<br>
且还补充了几句：
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an
excellent walker.  I shall never forget her appearance this
morning.  She really looked almost wild."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“总而言之，她除了跑路的本领以外，没有要<br>
样别的长处。她今儿早上那副样子我才永远忘<br>
不了呢，简直象个疯子。”
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"She did, indeed, Louisa.  I could hardly keep my countenance.
Very nonsensical to come at all!  Why must <u>she</u> be scampering
about the country, because her sister had a cold?  Her hair, so
untidy, so blowsy!"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“她的确象个疯子，露薏莎。我简直忍不住要<br>
笑出来。她这一趟来得无聊透顶；姐姐伤了点<br>
风，干吗要她那么大惊小怪地跑遍了整个村庄<br>
？──头发给弄得那么蓬乱，那么邋遢！”
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches
deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had
been let down to hide it not doing its office."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“是呀，还有她的衬裙──可惜你没看到她的<br>
衬裙。我绝对不是瞎说，那上面糊上了有足足<br>
六英寸泥，她把外面的裙子放低了些，想把来<br>
遮盖，可是遮盖不住。”
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but
this was all lost upon me.  I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet
looked remarkably well when she came into the room this
morning.  Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
彬格莱先生说：“你形容得并没有过火的地方<br>
，露薏莎，可是我并不以为然。我倒觉得伊丽<br>
莎白・班纳特小姐今儿早上走进屋来的时候，<br>
那种神情风度很不错呢。我并没有看到她的肮<br>
脏的衬裙。”
<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"<u>You</u> observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley;
"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see
<u>your</u> sister make such an exhibition."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“你一定看到的，达西先生，”彬格莱小姐说<br>
，“我想，你总不愿意看到你自己的姐妹弄成<br>
那副狼狈样子吧。”

"Certainly not."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“当然不愿意。“

</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it
is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!  What could
she mean by it?  It seems to me to show an abominable sort of
conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to
decorum."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“无缘无故赶上那么三英里路、五英里路，谁<br>
晓得多少英里呢，泥土盖没了踝骨，而且是孤<br>
孤单单的一个人！她这究竟是什么意思？我看<br>
她十足表现了没有家教的野态，完全是乡下人<br>
不懂礼貌的轻狂。“
<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
Bingley.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
彬格莱先生说：“那正说明了她的手足情深，<br>
真是好极了。”
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half
whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your
admiration of her fine eyes."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
彬格莱小姐死样怪气地说：“达西先生，我倒<br>
担心，她这次的冒失行为，会影响你对她那双<br>
美丽的眼睛的爱慕吧？”
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."
A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
达西回答道：“一点儿影响也没有，她跑过了<br>
这趟路以后，那双眼睛更加明亮了。”说完这<br>
句话，屋子里稍许沉默了一会儿，然后赫斯脱<br>
太太又开口说话：
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really
a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well
settled.  But with such a father and mother, and such low
connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“我非常关心吉英・班纳特──她倒的确是位<br>
可爱的姑娘──我诚心诚意地希望她好好儿攀<br>
门亲事。只可惜遇到那样的父母，加上还有那<br>
么些下流的亲戚，我怕她没有什么指望了。”
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on
Meryton."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“我不是听你说过，她有个姨爹在麦里屯当律<br>
师吗？”
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“是呀；她们还有个舅舅住在齐普赛附近。”
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“那真妙极了，”她的妹妹补充了一句，于是<br>
姐妹俩都纵情大笑。
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"If they had uncles enough to fill <u>all</u> Cheapside," cried
Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
彬格莱一听此话，便大叫起来：“即使她们有<br>
多得数不清的舅舅，可以把整个齐普赛都塞满<br>
，也不能把她们讨人喜爱的地方减损分毫。”
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men
of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“可是，她们倘使想嫁给有地位的男人，机会<br>
可就大大减少了，”达西回答道。
<BR></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it
their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the
expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
彬格莱先生没有理睬为句话；他的姐妹们却听<br>
得非常得意，于是越发放肆无忌地拿班纳特小<br>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her
room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till
summoned to coffee.  She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth
would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had
the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather
right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.  On
entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and
was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be
playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse,
said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below, with a book.  Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
不过她们一离开了饭厅，就重新做出百般温柔<br>
体贴的样子，来到吉英房间里，一直陪着她坐<br>
到喝咖啡的时候。吉英的病还不见好转，伊丽<br>
莎白寸步不离地守着她，一直到黄昏，看见她<br>
睡着了，才放下了心，觉得自己应该到楼下去<br>
一趟（虽说她并不乐意下楼去）。走进客厅，<br>
她发觉大家正在玩牌，大家当时立刻邀她也来<br>
玩，可是她恐怕他们输赢很大，便谢绝了，只<br>
推说放心不下姐姐，一会儿就得上楼去，她可<br>
以拿本书来消消遣遣。赫斯脱先生惊奇地朝她<br>
望了一下。

Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards
the table where a few books were lying.  He immediately offered
to fetch her others--all that his library afforded.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
伊丽莎白从心底里感激他，然后走到一张放了<br>

"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is
usually met with.  A woman must have a thorough knowledge of
music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to
deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain
something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her
voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but
half-deserved."

“噢，当然罗，”他的忠实助手叫起来了，“<br>
要是一个妇女不能超越常人，就不能算是多才<br>
多艺。一个女人必须精通音乐、歌唱、图画、<br>
舞蹈以及现代语文，那才当得起这个称号；除<br>
此以外，她的仪表和步态，她的声调，她的谈<br>
吐和表情，都得有相当风趣，否则她就不够资<br>

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice
of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew
many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst
called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention
to what was going forward.  As all conversation was thereby at
an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.

"Elizabeth Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was
closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to
recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their
own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.  But, in my
opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."

Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse,
and that she could not leave her.  Bingley urged Mr. Jones being
sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country
advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for
one of the most eminent physicians.  This she would not hear of;
but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's
proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for
early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they
were miserable.  They solaced their wretchedness, however, by
duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his
feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.

伊丽莎白又到他们这儿来了一次，只是为了告<br>
诉他们一声，她姐姐的病更加严重了，她不能<br>
离开。彬格醚再三主张立刻请钟斯大夫来，他<br>
的姐妹们却都以为乡下郎中无济于是，主张赶<br>
快到城里去请一位最有名的大夫来，伊丽莎白<br>
不赞成，不过她也不便太辜负她们兄弟的一番<br>
盛意，于是大家协商出了一个办法；如果班纳<br>

钟斯大夫来。彬格莱先生心里非常不安，他的<br>
姐姐和妹妹也说是十分担忧。吃过晚饭以后，<br>
她们俩总算合奏了几支歌来消除了一些烦闷，<br>
而彬格莱先生因为想不出好办法来解除焦虑，<br>
便只有关照他那管家婆尽心尽意地照料病人和<br>
病人的妹妹。
