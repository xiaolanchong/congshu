wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love
with her.  "How could you begin?" said she.  "I can comprehend
your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning;
but what could set you off in the first place?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白马上又高兴得顽皮起来了，她要达西<BR>

这个念头的？”<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the

看见了你什么样的风姿，听到了你什么样的谈<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners --
my behaviour to <I>you</I> was at least always bordering on the
uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to
give you pain than not.  Now be sincere; did you admire me for
my impertinence?"

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You may as well call it impertinence at once.  It was very
little less.  The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of
deference, of officious attention.  You were disgusted with the
women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for
<I>your</I> approbation alone.  I roused, and interested you,
because I was so unlike <I>them</I>.  Had you not been really
amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the
pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always
noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the
persons who so assiduously courted you.  There -- I have saved
you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things
considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.  To be
sure, you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of
<I>that</I> when they fall in love."

已经觉得讨厌。我所以会引起你的注目，打动<BR>
了你的心，就因为我不象她们。如果你不是一<BR>
个真正可爱的人，你一定会恨我这种地方；可<BR>
是，尽管你想尽办法来遮掩你自己，你的情感<BR>
毕竟是高贵的、正确的、你心目中根本看不起<BR>
那些拚命向你献媚的人。我这样一说，你就可<BR>

and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing
and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin
directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to
the point at last.  What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here?  Why, especially, when you
called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"

wonder how long you <I>would</I> have gone on, if you had been left
to yourself.  I wonder when you <I>would</I> have spoken, if I had
not asked you!  My resolution of thanking you for your kindness
to Lydia had certainly great effect.  <I>Too</I> <I>much</I>, I am
afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs
from a breach of promise?  for I ought not to have mentioned
the subject.  This will never do."

fair.  Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us
were the means of removing all my doubts.  I am not indebted
for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing
your gratitude.  I was not in a humour to wait for any opening
of your's.  My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was
determined at once to know every thing."

Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet
answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having <I>that</I>

almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost
three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">且说前些时候，舅母过高地估计了伊丽莎白和<BR>

一直还没有回答，现在有了这个可喜的消息告<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought
to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of
particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.
You supposed more than really existed.  But <I>now</I> suppose as
much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your
imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot
greatly err.  You must write again very soon, and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last.  I thank you, again
and again, for not going to the Lakes.  How could I be so silly
as to wish it!  Your idea of the ponies is delightful.  We will
go round the Park every day.  I am the happiest creature in the
world.  Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
with such justice.  I am happier even than Jane; she only
smiles, I laugh.  Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world
that he can spare from me.  You are all to come to Pemberley at
Christmas.  Your's, &amp;c."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">亲爱的舅母，蒙你写给我那封亲切而令人满意<BR>
的长信，告诉了我种种详情细节，本当早日回<BR>
信道谢，无奈我当时实在情绪不佳，因而不愿<BR>
意动笔。你当时所想象的情况，实在有些地甚<BR>
其辞。可是现在，你大可爱怎么想就怎么想了<BR>
。关于这件事，你可以放纵你的幻想，想到哪<BR>
里就是哪里，只要你不以为我已经结了婚，你<BR>
总不会猜想得太过分。你得马上再写封信来把<BR>
他赞美一番，而且要赞美得大大超过你上一封<BR>
信。我要多谢你没有带我到湖区去旅行。我真<BR>
傻，为什么以湖区去呢？你说要弄几匹小马去<BR>
游园，这个打算可真有意思。今后我们便可以<BR>
每天在那个园里兜圈子了。我现在成了天下最<BR>

approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and
insincere.  She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express
her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.
Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling
no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder
answer than she knew was deserved.

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any
congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn
family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas
lodge.  The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by
the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really
rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the
storm was blown over.  At such a moment, the arrival of
her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in
the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the
pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all
the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.  He bore
it, however, with admirable calmness.  He could even listen to
Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of
their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent
composure.  If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir
William was out of sight.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">柯林斯先生的回信还没有来，伊丽莎白也还没<BR>

苔琳夫人接到她姨侄那封信，大发雷霆，而夏<BR>
绿蒂对这门婚事偏偏非常欣喜，因此不得不火<BR>
速避开一下，等到这场暴风雨过去了以后再说<BR>

朋友来了，真是一件无上愉快的事，只可惜等<BR>
到见了面，看到柯林斯先生对达西那种极尽巴<BR>
结阿谀的样子，便不免认为这种愉快有些得不<BR>

廉・卢卡斯爵士，他恭维达西获得了当地最宝<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater,
tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as
her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the
familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet,
whenever she <I>did</I> speak, she must be vulgar.  Nor was her
respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely
to make her more elegant.  Elizabeth did all she could to
shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever
anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with
whom he might converse without mortification; and though the
uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the
season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope
of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time
when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party
at Pemberley.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">还有腓力普太太，她为人很粗俗，也许会叫达<BR>
西更加受不了。腓力普太太正象她姐姐一样，<BR>
见到彬格莱先生那么和颜悦色，于是攀谈起来<BR>
很是随便，而对达西则敬畏备至，不敢随便，<BR>
可是她的出言吐语总还是免不了粗俗。虽说她<BR>
因为尊敬达西而很少跟达西说话，可是她并不<BR>
因此而显得举止文雅一些。伊丽莎白为了不让<BR>
达西受到这些人的纠缠，便竭力使他跟她自己<BR>
谈话，跟她家里那些不会使他受罪的人谈话。<BR>
虽然这一番应酬大大减少了恋爱的乐趣，可是<BR>
却促进了她对未来生活的期望，她一心盼望赶<BR>
