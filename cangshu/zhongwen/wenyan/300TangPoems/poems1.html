							<span>Nice clothes invite pointing fingers,</span><br>

							<span>And the envoy of China was heart-broken, turning back home with his escort.</span><br>
							<span>...Cold fires now of old battles are grey on ancient forts,</span><br>
							<span>And the wilderness is shadowed with white new-flying snow.</span><br>
							<span>...When the player first brushes the Shang string and the Jue and then the Yu,</span><br>
							<span>Autumn-leaves in all four quarters are shaken with a murmur.</span><br>
							<span>Dong, the master,</span><br>
							<span>Must have been taught in heaven.</span><br>
							<span>Demons come from the deep pine-wood and stealthily listen</span><br>
							<span>To music slow, then quick, following his hand,</span><br>
							<span>Now far away, now near again, according to his heart.</span><br>
							<span>A hundred birds from an empty mountain scatter and return;</span><br>
							<span>Three thousand miles of floating clouds darken and lighten;</span><br>
							<span>A wildgoose fledgling, left behind, cries for its flock,</span><br>
							<span>And a Tartar child for the mother he loves.</span><br>
							<span>Then river waves are calmed</span><br>
							<span>And birds are mute that were singing,</span><br>
							<span>And Wuzu tribes are homesick for their distant land,</span><br>
							<span>And out of the dust of Siberian steppes rises a plaintive sorrow.</span><br>
							<span>...Suddenly the low sound leaps to a freer tune,</span><br>
							<span>Like a long wind swaying a forest, a downpour breaking tiles,</span><br>
							<span>A cascade through the air, flying over tree-tops.</span><br>
							<span>...A wild deer calls to his fellows. He is running among the mansions</span><br>
							<span>In the corner of the capital by the Eastern Palace wall....</span><br>
							<span>Phoenix Lake lies opposite the Gate of Green Jade;</span><br>
							<span>But how can fame and profit concern a man of genius?</span><br>

							<span>With bugles in the dawn he rouses his Grand Army;</span><br>
							<span>Drums like a tempest pound on four sides</span><br>
							<span>And the Yin Mountains shake with the shouts of ten thousand;</span><br>
							<span>Clouds and the war-wind whirl up in a point</span><br>

							<span>In the Dagger River mist, through a biting wind,</span><br>
							<span>Horseshoes, at the Sand Mouth line, break on icy boulders.</span><br>

								A DRAWING OF A HORSE BY GENERAL CAO <br> AT SECRETARY WEI FENG'S HOUSE
							
						</h4>
						<div class="tei_lg">

							<span>Throughout this dynasty no one had painted horses</span><br>
							<span>Like the master-spirit, Prince Jiangdu --</span><br>
							<span>And then to General Cao through his thirty years of fame</span><br>
							<span>The world's gaze turned, for royal steeds.</span><br>
							<span>He painted the late Emperor's luminous white horse.</span><br>
							<span>For ten days the thunder flew over Dragon Lake,</span><br>
							<span>And a pink-agate plate was sent him from the palace - </span><br>
							<span>The talk of the court-ladies, the marvel of all eyes.</span><br>
							<span>The General danced, receiving it in his honoured home</span><br>
							<span>After this rare gift, followed rapidly fine silks</span><br>
							<span>From many of the nobles, requesting that his art</span><br>
							<span>Lend a new lustre to their screens.</span><br>
							<span>...First came the curly-maned horse of Emperor Taizong,</span><br>
							<span>Then, for the Guos, a lion-spotted horse....</span><br>
							<span>But now in this painting I see two horses,</span><br>
							<span>A sobering sight for whosoever knew them.</span><br>
							<span>They are war- horses. Either could face ten thousand.</span><br>
							<span>They make the white silk stretch away into a vast desert.</span><br>
							<span>And the seven others with them are almost as noble</span><br>
							<span>Mist and snow are moving across a cold sky,</span><br>
							<span>And hoofs are cleaving snow-drifts under great trees -</span><br>
							<span>With here a group of officers and there a group of servants.</span><br>
							<span>See how these nine horses all vie with one another - </span><br>
							<span>The high clear glance, the deep firm breath.</span><br>
							<span>...Who understands distinction? Who really cares for art?</span><br>
							<span>You, Wei Feng, have followed Cao; Zhidun preceded him.</span><br>
							<span>...I remember when the late Emperor came toward his Summer Palace,</span><br>
							<span>The procession, in green-feathered rows, swept from the eastern sky --</span><br>
							<span>Thirty thousand horses, prancing, galloping,</span><br>
							<span>Fashioned, every one of them, like the horses in this picture....</span><br>
							<span>But now the Imperial Ghost receives secret jade from the River God,</span><br>
							<span>For the Emperor hunts crocodiles no longer by the streams.</span><br>
							<span>Where you see his Great Gold Tomb, you may hear among the pines</span><br>
							<span>A bird grieving in the wind that the Emperor's horses are gone.</span><br>

						<div class="tei_lg">

							<span>O General, descended from Wei's Emperor Wu,</span><br>
							<span>You are nobler now than when a noble....</span><br>
							<span>Conquerors and their valour perish,</span><br>
							<span>But masters of beauty live forever.</span><br>
							<span>...With your brush-work learned from Lady Wei</span><br>
							<span>And second only to Wang Xizhi's,</span><br>
							<span>Faithful to your art, you know no age,</span><br>
							<span>Letting wealth and fame drift by like clouds.</span><br>
							<span>...In the years of Kaiyuan you were much with the Emperor,</span><br>
							<span>Accompanied him often to the Court of the South Wind.</span><br>
							<span>When the spirit left great statesmen, on walls of the Hall of Fame</span><br>
							<span>The point of your brush preserved their living faces.</span><br>
							<span>You crowned all the premiers with coronets of office;</span><br>
							<span>You fitted all commanders with arrows at their girdles;</span><br>
							<span>You made the founders of this dynasty, with every hair alive,</span><br>
							<span>Seem to be just back from the fierceness of a battle.</span><br>
							<span>...The late Emperor had a horse, known as Jade Flower,</span><br>
							<span>Whom artists had copied in various poses.</span><br>
							<span>They led him one day to the red marble stairs</span><br>
							<span>With his eyes toward the palace in the deepening air.</span><br>
							<span>Then, General, commanded to proceed with your work,</span><br>
							<span>You centred all your being on a piece of silk.</span><br>
							<span>And later, when your dragon-horse, born of the sky,</span><br>
							<span>Had banished earthly horses for ten thousand generations,</span><br>
							<span>There was one Jade Flower standing on the dais</span><br>
							<span>And another by the steps, and they marvelled at each other....</span><br>
							<span>The Emperor rewarded you with smiles and with gifts,</span><br>
							<span>While officers and men of the stud hung about and stared.</span><br>
							<span>...Han Gan, your follower, has likewise grown proficient</span><br>
							<span>At representing horses in all their attitudes;</span><br>
							<span>But picturing the flesh, he fails to draw the bone -</span><br>
							<span>So that even the finest are deprived of their spirit.</span><br>
							<span>You, beyond the mere skill, used your art divinely - </span><br>
							<span>And expressed, not only horses, but the life of a good man....</span><br>
							<span>Yet here you are, wandering in a world of disorder</span><br>
							<span>And sketching from time to time some petty passerby</span><br>
							<span>People note your case with the whites of their eyes.</span><br>
							<span>There's nobody purer, there's nobody poorer.</span><br>
							<span>...Read in the records, from earliest times,</span><br>
							<span>How hard it is to be a great artist.</span><br>

								A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO A GIRL-PUPIL <br> OF LADY GONGSUN
							
						</h4>

						<div><a name=""></a><div class="tei_note_number">[_]</div> On the 19th of the Tenth-month in the second year of Dali, I saw, in the house of the Kueifu official Yuante, a girl named Li from Lingying
							dancing with a dagger. I admired her skill and asked who was her teacher. She named Lady Gongsun. I remembered that in the third year of Kaiyuan at Yancheng, when I
							was a little boy, I saw Lady Gongsun dance. She was the only one in the Imperial Theatre who could dance with this weapon. Now she is aged and unknown, and even her
							pupil has passed the heyday of beauty. I wrote this poem to express my wistfulness. The work of Zhang Xu of the Wu district, that great master of grassy writing, was
							improved by his having been present when Lady Gongsun danced in the Yeh district. From this may be judged the art of Gongsun. </div>
						<div class="tei_lg">
							<span>There lived years ago the beautiful Gongsun,</span><br>
							<span>Who, dancing with her dagger, drew from all four quarters</span><br>
							<span>An audience like mountains lost among themselves.</span><br>
							<span>Heaven and earth moved back and forth, following her motions,</span><br>
							<span>Which were bright as when the Archer shot the nine suns down the sky</span><br>
							<span>And rapid as angels before the wings of dragons.</span><br>
							<span>She began like a thunderbolt, venting its anger,</span><br>
							<span>And ended like the shining calm of rivers and the sea....</span><br>
							<span>But vanished are those red lips and those pearly sleeves;</span><br>
							<span>And none but this one pupil bears the perfume of her fame,</span><br>
							<span>This beauty from Lingying, at the Town of the White God,</span><br>
							<span>Dancing still and singing in the old blithe way.</span><br>
							<span>And while we reply to each other's questions,</span><br>
							<span>We sigh together, saddened by changes that have come.</span><br>
							<span>There were eight thousand ladies in the late Emperor's court,</span><br>
							<span>But none could dance the dagger-dance like Lady Gongsun.</span><br>
							<span>...Fifty years have passed, like the turning of a palm;</span><br>
							<span>Wind and dust, filling the world, obscure the Imperial House.</span><br>
							<span>Instead of the Pear-Garden Players, who have blown by like a mist,</span><br>
							<span>There are one or two girl-musicians now-trying to charm the cold Sun.</span><br>
							<span>There are man-size trees by the Emperor's Golden Tomb</span><br>
							<span>I seem to hear dead grasses rattling on the cliffs of Qutang.</span><br>
							<span>...The song is done, the slow string and quick pipe have ceased.</span><br>

							<span>On the old wall, said the priest, were Buddhas finely painted,</span><br>

							<span>The fine clouds have opened and the River of Stars is gone,</span><br>

							<span>As I offer you a cup of wine, asking you to sing.</span><br>

							<span>The crowning of an emperor, a change in the realm.</span><br>
							<span>The edict granting pardons runs three hundred miles a day,</span><br>
							<span>All those who were to die have had their sentences commuted,</span><br>

							<span>My rank is very low and useless to refer to;</span><br>
							<span>They might punish me with lashes in the dust of the street.</span><br>
							<span>Most of my fellow exiles are now returning home --</span><br>
							<span>A journey which, to me, is a heaven beyond climbing."</span><br>
							<span>...Stop your song, I beg you, and listen to mine,</span><br>
							<span>A song that is utterly different from yours:</span><br>
							<span>"Tonight is the loveliest moon of the year.</span><br>
							<span>All else is with fate, not ours to control;</span><br>
							<span>But, refusing this wine, may we choose more tomorrow?"</span><br>

								STOPPING AT A TEMPLE ON HENG MOUNTAIN I <br> INSCRIBE THIS POEM IN THE GATE-TOWER

							
						</h4>
						<div class="tei_lg">

							<span>The five Holy Mountains have the rank of the Three Dukes.</span><br>
							<span>The other four make a ring, with the Song Mountain midmost.</span><br>
							<span>To this one, in the fire-ruled south, where evil signs are rife,</span><br>
							<span>Heaven gave divine power, ordaining it a peer.</span><br>
							<span>All the clouds and hazes are hidden in its girdle;</span><br>
							<span>And its forehead is beholden only by a few.</span><br>
							<span>...I came here in autumn, during the rainy season,</span><br>
							<span>When the sky was overcast and the clear wind gone.</span><br>
							<span>I quieted my mind and prayed, hoping for an answer;</span><br>
							<span>For assuredly righteous thinking reaches to high heaven.</span><br>
							<span>And soon all the mountain-peaks were showing me their faces;</span><br>
							<span>I looked up at a pinnacle that held the clean blue sky:</span><br>
							<span>The wide Purple-Canopy joined the Celestial Column;</span><br>
							<span>The Stone Granary leapt, while the Fire God stood still.</span><br>
							<span>Moved by this token, I dismounted to offer thanks.</span><br>
							<span>A long path of pine and cypress led to the temple.</span><br>
							<span>Its white walls and purple pillars shone, and the vivid colour</span><br>
							<span>Of gods and devils filled the place with patterns of red and blue.</span><br>
							<span>I climbed the steps and, bending down to sacrifice, besought</span><br>
							<span>That my pure heart might be welcome, in spite of my humble offering.</span><br>
							<span>The old priest professed to know the judgment of the God:</span><br>
							<span>He was polite and reverent, making many bows.</span><br>
							<span>He handed me divinity-cups, he showed me how to use them</span><br>
							<span>And told me that my fortune was the very best of all.</span><br>
							<span>Though exiled to a barbarous land, mine is a happy life.</span><br>
							<span>Plain food and plain clothes are all I ever wanted.</span><br>
							<span>To be prince, duke, premier, general, was never my desire;</span><br>
							<span>And if the God would bless me, what better could he grant than this ? --</span><br>
							<span>At night I lie down to sleep in the top of a high tower;</span><br>
							<span>While moon and stars glimmer through the darkness of the clouds....</span><br>
							<span>Apes call, a bell sounds. And ready for dawn</span><br>
							<span>I see arise, far in the east the cold bright sun.</span><br>

								A POEM ON THE STONE DRUMS
							
						</h4>
						<div class="tei_lg">

							<span>Chang handed me this tracing, from the stone drums,</span><br>
							<span>Beseeching me to write a poem on the stone drums.</span><br>
							<span>Du Fu has gone. Li Bai is dead.</span><br>
							<span>What can my poor talent do for the stone drums?</span><br>
							<span>...When the Zhou power waned and China was bubbling,</span><br>
							<span>Emperor Xuan, up in wrath, waved his holy spear:</span><br>
							<span>And opened his Great Audience, receiving all the tributes</span><br>
							<span>Of kings and lords who came to him with a tune of clanging weapons.</span><br>
							<span>They held a hunt in Qiyang and proved their marksmanship:</span><br>
							<span>Fallen birds and animals were strewn three thousand miles.</span><br>
							<span>And the exploit was recorded, to inform new generations....</span><br>
							<span>Cut out of jutting cliffs, these drums made of stone - </span><br>
							<span>On which poets and artisans, all of the first order,</span><br>
							<span>Had indited and chiselled-were set in the deep mountains</span><br>
							<span>To be washed by rain, baked by sun, burned by wildfire,</span><br>
							<span>Eyed by evil spirits; and protected by the gods.</span><br>
							<span>...Where can he have found the tracing on this paper? --</span><br>
							<span>True to the original, not altered by a hair,</span><br>
							<span>The meaning deep, the phrases cryptic, difficult to read.</span><br>
							<span>And the style of the characters neither square nor tadpole.</span><br>
							<span>Time has not yet vanquished the beauty of these letters --</span><br>
							<span>Looking like sharp daggers that pierce live crocodiles,</span><br>
							<span>Like phoenix-mates dancing, like angels hovering down,</span><br>
							<span>Like trees of jade and coral with interlocking branches,</span><br>
							<span>Like golden cord and iron chain tied together tight,</span><br>
							<span>Like incense-tripods flung in the sea, like dragons mounting heaven.</span><br>
							<span>Historians, gathering ancient poems, forgot to gather these,</span><br>
							<span>To make the two Books of Musical Song more colourful and striking;</span><br>
							<span>Confucius journeyed in the west, but not to the Qin Kingdom,</span><br>
							<span>He chose our planet and our stars but missed the sun and moon</span><br>
							<span>I who am fond of antiquity, was born too late</span><br>
							<span>And, thinking of these wonderful things, cannot hold back my tears....</span><br>
							<span>I remember, when I was awarded my highest degree,</span><br>
							<span>During the first year of Yuanho,</span><br>
							<span>How a friend of mine, then at the western camp,</span><br>
							<span>Offered to assist me in removing these old relics.</span><br>
							<span>I bathed and changed, then made my plea to the college president</span><br>
							<span>And urged on him the rareness of these most precious things.</span><br>
							<span>They could be wrapped in rugs, be packed and sent in boxes</span><br>
							<span>And carried on only a few camels: ten stone drums</span><br>
							<span>To grace the Imperial Temple like the Incense-Pot of Gao -- </span><br>
							<span>Or their lustre and their value would increase a hundredfold,</span><br>
							<span>If the monarch would present them to the university,</span><br>
							<span>Where students could study them and doubtless decipher them,</span><br>
							<span>And multitudes, attracted to the capital of culture</span><br>
							<span>Prom all corners of the Empire, would be quick to gather.</span><br>
							<span>We could scour the moss, pick out the dirt, restore the original surface,</span><br>
							<span>And lodge them in a fitting and secure place for ever,</span><br>
							<span>Covered by a massive building with wide eaves</span><br>
							<span>Where nothing more might happen to them as it had before.</span><br>
							<span>...But government officials grow fixed in their ways</span><br>
							<span>And never will initiate beyond old precedent;</span><br>
							<span>So herd- boys strike the drums for fire, cows polish horns on them,</span><br>
							<span>With no one to handle them reverentially.</span><br>
							<span>Still ageing and decaying, soon they may be effaced.</span><br>
							<span>Six years I have sighed for them, chanting toward the west....</span><br>
							<span>The familiar script of Wang Xizhi, beautiful though it was,</span><br>
							<span>Could be had, several pages, just for a few white geese,</span><br>
							<span>But now, eight dynasties after the Zhou, and all the wars over,</span><br>
							<span>Why should there be nobody caring for these drums?</span><br>
							<span>The Empire is at peace, the government free.</span><br>
							<span>Poets again are honoured and Confucians and Mencians....</span><br>
							<span>Oh, how may this petition be carried to the throne?</span><br>
							<span>It needs indeed an eloquent flow, like a cataract - </span><br>
							<span>But, alas, my voice has broken, in my song of the stone drums,</span><br>
							<span>To a sound of supplication choked with its own tears.</span><br>

								Bai Juyi
								A SONG OF UNENDING SORROW
							
						</h4>
						<div class="tei_lg">

							<span>China's Emperor, craving beauty that might shake an empire,</span><br>
							<span>Was on the throne for many years, searching, never finding,</span><br>
							<span>Till a little child of the Yang clan, hardly even grown,</span><br>
							<span>Bred in an inner chamber, with no one knowing her,</span><br>
							<span>But with graces granted by heaven and not to be concealed,</span><br>
							<span>At last one day was chosen for the imperial household.</span><br>
							<span>If she but turned her head and smiled, there were cast a hundred spells,</span><br>
							<span>And the powder and paint of the Six Palaces faded into nothing.</span><br>
							<span>...It was early spring. They bathed her in the FlowerPure Pool,</span><br>
							<span>Which warmed and smoothed the creamy-tinted crystal of her skin,</span><br>
							<span>And, because of her languor, a maid was lifting her</span><br>
							<span>When first the Emperor noticed her and chose her for his bride.</span><br>
							<span>The cloud of her hair, petal of her cheek, gold ripples of her crown when she moved,</span><br>
							<span>Were sheltered on spring evenings by warm hibiscus curtains;</span><br>
							<span>But nights of spring were short and the sun arose too soon,</span><br>
							<span>And the Emperor, from that time forth, forsook his early hearings</span><br>
							<span>And lavished all his time on her with feasts and revelry,</span><br>
							<span>His mistress of the spring, his despot of the night.</span><br>
							<span>There were other ladies in his court, three thousand of rare beauty,</span><br>
							<span>But his favours to three thousand were concentered in one body.</span><br>
							<span>By the time she was dressed in her Golden Chamber, it would be almost evening;</span><br>
							<span>And when tables were cleared in the Tower of Jade, she would loiter, slow with wine.</span><br>
							<span>Her sisters and her brothers all were given titles;</span><br>
							<span>And, because she so illumined and glorified her clan,</span><br>
							<span>She brought to every father, every mother through the empire,</span><br>
							<span>Happiness when a girl was born rather than a boy.</span><br>
							<span>...High rose Li Palace, entering blue clouds,</span><br>
							<span>And far and wide the breezes carried magical notes</span><br>
							<span>Of soft song and slow dance, of string and bamboo music.</span><br>
							<span>The Emperor's eyes could never gaze on her enough - </span><br>
							<span>Till war-drums, booming from Yuyang, shocked the whole earth</span><br>
							<span>And broke the tunes of <i>The Rainbow Skirt and the Feathered Coat</i>.</span><br>
							<span>The Forbidden City, the nine-tiered palace, loomed in the dust</span><br>
							<span>From thousands of horses and chariots headed southwest.</span><br>
							<span>The imperial flag opened the way, now moving and now pausing - -</span><br>
							<span>But thirty miles from the capital, beyond the western gate,</span><br>
							<span>The men of the army stopped, not one of them would stir</span><br>
							<span>Till under their horses' hoofs they might trample those moth- eyebrows....</span><br>
							<span>Flowery hairpins fell to the ground, no one picked them up,</span><br>
							<span>And a green and white jade hair-tassel and a yellowgold hair- bird. </span><br>
							<span>The Emperor could not save her, he could only cover his face.</span><br>
							<span>And later when he turned to look, the place of blood and tears</span><br>
							<span>Was hidden in a yellow dust blown by a cold wind.</span><br>
							<span>... At the cleft of the Dagger-Tower Trail they crisscrossed through a cloud-line</span><br>
							<span>Under Omei Mountain. The last few came.</span><br>
							<span>Flags and banners lost their colour in the fading sunlight....</span><br>
							<span>But as waters of Shu are always green and its mountains always blue,</span><br>
							<span>So changeless was His Majesty's love and deeper than the days.</span><br>
							<span>He stared at the desolate moon from his temporary palace.</span><br>
							<span>He heard bell-notes in the evening rain, cutting at his breast.</span><br>
							<span>And when heaven and earth resumed their round and the dragon car faced home,</span><br>
							<span>The Emperor clung to the spot and would not turn away</span><br>
							<span>From the soil along the Mawei slope, under which was buried</span><br>
							<span>That memory, that anguish. Where was her jade-white face?</span><br>
							<span>Ruler and lords, when eyes would meet, wept upon their coats</span><br>
							<span>As they rode, with loose rein, slowly eastward, back to the capital.</span><br>
							<span>...The pools, the gardens, the palace, all were just as before,</span><br>
							<span>The Lake Taiye hibiscus, the Weiyang Palace willows;</span><br>
							<span>But a petal was like her face and a willow-leaf her eyebrow -- </span><br>
							<span>And what could he do but cry whenever he looked at them?</span><br>
							<span>...Peach-trees and plum-trees blossomed, in the winds of spring;</span><br>
							<span>Lakka-foliage fell to the ground, after autumn rains;</span><br>
							<span>The Western and Southern Palaces were littered with late grasses,</span><br>
							<span>And the steps were mounded with red leaves that no one swept away.</span><br>
							<span>Her Pear-Garden Players became white-haired</span><br>
							<span>And the eunuchs thin-eyebrowed in her Court of PepperTrees;</span><br>
							<span>Over the throne flew fire-flies, while he brooded in the twilight.</span><br>
							<span>He would lengthen the lamp-wick to its end and still could never sleep.</span><br>
							<span>Bell and drum would slowly toll the dragging nighthours</span><br>
							<span>And the River of Stars grow sharp in the sky, just before dawn,</span><br>
							<span>And the porcelain mandarin-ducks on the roof grow thick with morning frost</span><br>
							<span>And his covers of kingfisher-blue feel lonelier and colder</span><br>
							<span>With the distance between life and death year after year;</span><br>
							<span>And yet no beloved spirit ever visited his dreams.</span><br>
							<span>...At Lingqiong lived a Taoist priest who was a guest of heaven,</span><br>
							<span>Able to summon spirits by his concentrated mind.</span><br>
							<span>And people were so moved by the Emperor's constant brooding</span><br>
							<span>That they besought the Taoist priest to see if he could find her.</span><br>
							<span>He opened his way in space and clove the ether like lightning,</span><br>
							<span>Up to heaven, under the earth, looking everywhere.</span><br>
							<span>Above, he searched the Green Void, below, the Yellow Spring;</span><br>
							<span>But he failed, in either place, to find the one he looked for.</span><br>
							<span>And then he heard accounts of an enchanted isle at sea,</span><br>
							<span>A part of the intangible and incorporeal world,</span><br>
							<span>With pavilions and fine towers in the five-coloured air,</span><br>
							<span>And of exquisite immortals moving to and fro,</span><br>
							<span>And of one among them-whom they called The Ever True -</span><br>
							<span>With a face of snow and flowers resembling hers he sought.</span><br>
							<span>So he went to the West Hall's gate of gold and knocked at the jasper door</span><br>
							<span>And asked a girl, called Morsel-of-Jade, to tell The Doubly- Perfect.</span><br>
							<span>And the lady, at news of an envoy from the Emperor of China,</span><br>
							<span>Was startled out of dreams in her nine-flowered, canopy.</span><br>
							<span>She pushed aside her pillow, dressed, shook away sleep,</span><br>
							<span>And opened the pearly shade and then the silver screen.</span><br>
							<span>Her cloudy hair-dress hung on one side because of her great haste,</span><br>
							<span>And her flower-cap was loose when she came along the terrace,</span><br>
							<span>While a light wind filled her cloak and fluttered with her motion</span><br>
							<span>As though she danced <i>The Rainbow Skirt and the Feathered Coat</i>.</span><br>
							<span>And the tear-drops drifting down her sad white face</span><br>
							<span>Were like a rain in spring on the blossom of the pear.</span><br>
							<span>But love glowed deep within her eyes when she bade him thank her liege,</span><br>
							<span>Whose form and voice had been strange to her ever since their parting --</span><br>
							<span>Since happiness had ended at the Court of the Bright Sun,</span><br>
							<span>And moons and dawns had become long in Fairy-Mountain Palace.</span><br>
							<span>But when she turned her face and looked down toward the earth</span><br>
							<span>And tried to see the capital, there were only fog and dust.</span><br>
							<span>So she took out, with emotion, the pledges he had given</span><br>
							<span>And, through his envoy, sent him back a shell box and gold hairpin,</span><br>
							<span>But kept one branch of the hairpin and one side of the box,</span><br>
							<span>Breaking the gold of the hairpin, breaking the shell of the box;</span><br>
							<span>"Our souls belong together," she said, " like this gold and this shell --</span><br>
							<span>Somewhere, sometime, on earth or in heaven, we shall surely</span><br>
							<span>And she sent him, by his messenger, a sentence reminding him</span><br>
							<span>Of vows which had been known only to their two hearts:</span><br>
							<span>"On the seventh day of the Seventh-month, in the Palace of Long Life,</span><br>
							<span>We told each other secretly in the quiet midnight world</span><br>
							<span>That we wished to fly in heaven, two birds with the wings of one,</span><br>
							<span>And to grow together on the earth, two branches of one tree."</span><br>
							<span>Earth endures, heaven endures; some time both shall end,</span><br>
							<span>While this unending sorrow goes on and on for ever.</span><br>

								Bai Chuyi
								THE SONG OF A GUITAR
							
						</h4>



						<div><a name=""></a><div class="tei_note_number">[_]</div> In the tenth year of Yuanhe I was banished and demoted to be assistant official in Jiujiang. In the summer of the next year I was seeing a friend
							leave Penpu and heard in the midnight from a neighbouring boat a guitar played in the manner of the capital. Upon inquiry, I found that the player had formerly been a
							dancing-girl there and in her maturity had been married to a merchant. I invited her to my boat to have her play for us. She told me her story, heyday and then
							unhappiness. Since my departure from the capital I had not felt sad; but that night, after I left her, I began to realize my banishment. And I wrote this long poem
							--six hundred and twelve characters. </div>


						<div class="tei_lg">
							<span>I was bidding a guest farewell, at night on the Xunyang River,</span><br>
							<span>Where maple-leaves and full-grown rushes rustled in the autumn.</span><br>
							<span>I, the host, had dismounted, my guest had boarded his boat,</span><br>
							<span>And we raised our cups and wished to drink-but, alas, there was no music.</span><br>
							<span>For all we had drunk we felt no joy and were parting from each other,</span><br>
							<span>When the river widened mysteriously toward the full moon -- </span><br>
							<span>We had heard a sudden sound, a guitar across the water.</span><br>
							<span>Host forgot to turn back home, and guest to go his way.</span><br>
							<span>We followed where the melody led and asked the player's name.</span><br>
							<span>The sound broke off...then reluctantly she answered.</span><br>
							<span>We moved our boat near hers, invited her to join us,</span><br>
							<span>Summoned more wine and lanterns to recommence our banquet.</span><br>
							<span>Yet we called and urged a thousand times before she started toward us,</span><br>
							<span>Still hiding half her face from us behind her guitar.</span><br>
							<span>...She turned the tuning-pegs and tested several strings;</span><br>
							<span>We could feel what she was feeling, even before she played:</span><br>
							<span>Each string a meditation, each note a deep thought,</span><br>
							<span>As if she were telling us the ache of her whole life.</span><br>
							<span>She knit her brows, flexed her fingers, then began her music,</span><br>
							<span>Little by little letting her heart share everything with ours.</span><br>
							<span>She brushed the strings, twisted them slow, swept them, plucked them --</span><br>
							<span>First the air of <i>The Rainbow Skirt</i>, then <i>The Six Little Ones</i>.</span><br>
							<span>The large strings hummed like rain,</span><br>
							<span>The small strings whispered like a secret,</span><br>
							<span>Hummed, whispered-and then were intermingled</span><br>
							<span>Like a pouring of large and small pearls into a plate of jade.</span><br>
							<span>We heard an oriole, liquid, hidden among flowers.</span><br>
							<span>We heard a brook bitterly sob along a bank of sand...</span><br>
							<span>By the checking of its cold touch, the very string seemed broken</span><br>
							<span>As though it could not pass; and the notes, dying away</span><br>
							<span>Into a depth of sorrow and concealment of lament,</span><br>
							<span>Told even more in silence than they had told in sound....</span><br>
							<span>A silver vase abruptly broke with a gush of water,</span><br>
							<span>And out leapt armored horses and weapons that clashed and smote --</span><br>
							<span>And, before she laid her pick down, she ended with one stroke,</span><br>
							<span>And all four strings made one sound, as of rending silk</span><br>
							<span>There was quiet in the east boat and quiet in the west,</span><br>
							<span>And we saw the white autumnal moon enter the river's heart.</span><br>
							<span>...When she had slowly placed the pick back among the strings,</span><br>
							<span>She rose and smoothed her clothing and, formal, courteous,</span><br>
							<span>Told us how she had spent her girlhood at the capital,</span><br>
							<span>Living in her parents' house under the Mount of Toads,</span><br>
							<span>And had mastered the guitar at the age of thirteen,</span><br>
							<span>With her name recorded first in the class-roll of musicians,</span><br>
							<span>Her art the admiration even of experts,</span><br>
							<span>Her beauty the envy of all the leading dancers,</span><br>
							<span>How noble youths of Wuling had lavishly competed</span><br>
							<span>And numberless red rolls of silk been given for one song,</span><br>
							<span>And silver combs with shell inlay been snapped by her rhythms,</span><br>
							<span>And skirts the colour of blood been spoiled with stains of wine....</span><br>
							<span>Season after season, joy had followed joy,</span><br>
							<span>Autumn moons and spring winds had passed without her heeding,</span><br>
							<span>Till first her brother left for the war, and then her aunt died,</span><br>
							<span>And evenings went and evenings came, and her beauty faded -- </span><br>
							<span>With ever fewer chariots and horses at her door;</span><br>
							<span>So that finally she gave herself as wife to a merchant</span><br>
							<span>Who, prizing money first, careless how he left her,</span><br>
							<span>Had gone, a month before, to Fuliang to buy tea.</span><br>
							<span>And she had been tending an empty boat at the river's mouth,</span><br>
							<span>No company but the bright moon and the cold water.</span><br>
							<span>And sometimes in the deep of night she would dream of her triumphs</span><br>
							<span>And be wakened from her dreams by the scalding of her tears.</span><br>
							<span>Her very first guitar-note had started me sighing;</span><br>
							<span>Now, having heard her story, I was sadder still.</span><br>
							<span>"We are both unhappy -- to the sky's end.</span><br>
							<span>We meet. We understand. What does acquaintance matter?</span><br>
							<span>I came, a year ago, away from the capital</span><br>
							<span>And am now a sick exile here in Jiujiang --</span><br>
							<span>And so remote is Jiujiang that I have heard no music,</span><br>
							<span>Neither string nor bamboo, for a whole year.</span><br>
							<span>My quarters, near the River Town, are low and damp,</span><br>
							<span>With bitter reeds and yellowed rushes all about the house.</span><br>
							<span>And what is to be heard here, morning and evening? -- </span><br>
							<span>The bleeding cry of cuckoos, the whimpering of apes.</span><br>
							<span>On flowery spring mornings and moonlit autumn nights</span><br>
							<span>I have often taken wine up and drunk it all alone,</span><br>
							<span>Of course there are the mountain songs and the village pipes,</span><br>
							<span>But they are crude and-strident, and grate on my ears.</span><br>
							<span>And tonight, when I heard you playing your guitar,</span><br>
							<span>I felt as if my hearing were bright with fairymusic.</span><br>
							<span>Do not leave us. Come, sit down. Play for us again.</span><br>
							<span>And I will write a long song concerning a guitar."</span><br>
							<span>...Moved by what I said, she stood there for a moment,</span><br>
							<span>Then sat again to her strings-and they sounded even sadder,</span><br>
							<span>Although the tunes were different from those she had played before....</span><br>
							<span>The feasters, all listening, covered their faces.</span><br>
							<span>But who of them all was crying the most?</span><br>
							<span>This Jiujiang official. My blue sleeve was wet.</span><br>

							<span>Captured the bandit chieftains for the Imperial Temple.</span><br>
							<span>So complete a victory was a supreme event;</span><br>
							<span>And the Emperor said: "To you, Du, should go the highest honour,</span><br>
							<span>And your secretary, Yu, should write a record of it."</span><br>
							<span>When Yu had bowed his head, he leapt and danced, saying:</span><br>
							<span>"Historical writings on stone and metal are my especial art;</span><br>
							<span>And, since I know the finest brush-work of the old masters,</span><br>
							<span>My duty in this instance is more than merely official,</span><br>
							<span>And I should be at fault if I modestly declined."</span><br>
							<span>The Emperor, on hearing this, nodded many times.</span><br>
							<span>And Yu retired and fasted and, in a narrow workroom,</span><br>
							<span>His great brush thick with ink as with drops of rain,</span><br>
							<span>Chose characters like those in the Canons of Yao and Xun,</span><br>
							<span>And a style as in the ancient poems Qingmiao and Shengmin.</span><br>
							<span>And soon the description was ready, on a sheet of paper.</span><br>
							<span>In the morning he laid it, with a bow, on the purple stairs.</span><br>
							<span>He memorialized the throne: "I, unworthy,</span><br>
							<span>Have dared to record this exploit, for a monument."</span><br>
							<span>The tablet was thirty feet high, the characters large as dippers;</span><br>
							<span>It was set on a sacred tortoise, its columns flanked with ragons....</span><br>
							<span>The phrases were strange with deep words that few could understand;</span><br>
							<span>And jealousy entered and malice and reached the Emperor --</span><br>
							<span>So that a rope a hundred feet long pulled the tablet down</span><br>
							<span>And coarse sand and small stones ground away its face.</span><br>
							<span>But literature endures, like the universal spirit,</span><br>
							<span>And its breath becomes a part of the vitals of all men.</span><br>
							<span>The Tang plate, the Confucian tripod, are eternal things,</span><br>
							<span>Not because of their forms, but because of their inscriptions....</span><br>
							<span>Sagacious is our sovereign and wise his minister,</span><br>
							<span>And high their successes and prosperous their reign;</span><br>
							<span>But unless it be recorded by a writing such as this,</span><br>
							<span>How may they hope to rival the three and five good rulers?</span><br>
							<span>I wish I could write ten thousand copies to read ten thousand times,</span><br>
							<span>Till spittle ran from my lips and calluses hardened my fingers,</span><br>
							<span>And still could hand them down, through seventy-two generations,</span><br>
							<span>As corner-stones for Rooms of Great Deeds on the Sacred Mountains.</span><br>

								A SONG OF THE YAN COUNTRY
							
						</h4>


						<div><a name=""></a><div class="tei_note_number">[_]</div> In the sixth year of Kaiyuan, a friend returned from the border and showed me the Yan Song. Moved by what he told me of the expedition, I have
							written this poem to the same rhymes. </div>
						<div class="tei_lg">
							<span>The northeastern border of China was dark with smoke and dust.</span><br>
							<span>To repel the savage invaders, our generals, leaving their families,</span><br>
							<span>Strode forth together, looking as heroes should look;</span><br>
							<span>And having received from the Emperor his most gracious favour,</span><br>
							<span>They marched to the beat of gong and drum through the Elm Pass.</span><br>
							<span>They circled the Stone Tablet with a line of waving flags,</span><br>
							<span>Till their captains over the Sea of Sand were twanging feathered orders.</span><br>
							<span>The Tartar chieftain's hunting-fires glimmered along Wolf Mountain,</span><br>
							<span>And heights and rivers were cold and bleak there at the outer border;</span><br>
							<span>But soon the barbarians' horses were plunging through wind and rain.</span><br>
							<span>Half of our men at the front were killed, but the other half are living,</span><br>
							<span>And still at the camp beautiful girls dance for them and sing.</span><br>
							<span>...As autumn ends in the grey sand, with the grasses all withered,</span><br>
							<span>The few surviving watchers by the lonely wall at sunset,</span><br>
							<span>Serving in a good cause, hold life and the foeman lightly.</span><br>
							<span>And yet, for all that they have done, Elm Pass is still unsafe.</span><br>
							<span>Still at the front, iron armour is worn and battered thin,</span><br>
							<span>And here at home food-sticks are made of jade tears.</span><br>
							<span>Still in this southern city young wives' hearts are breaking,</span><br>
							<span>While soldiers at the northern border vainly look toward home.</span><br>
							<span>The fury of the wind cuts our men's advance</span><br>
							<span>In a place of death and blue void, with nothingness ahead.</span><br>
							<span>Three times a day a cloud of slaughter rises over the camp;</span><br>
							<span>And all night long the hour-drums shake their chilly booming,</span><br>
							<span>Until white swords can be seen again, spattered with red blood.</span><br>
							<span>...When death becomes a duty, who stops to think of fame?</span><br>
							<span>Yet in speaking of the rigours of warfare on the desert</span><br>
							<span>We name to this day Li, the great General, who lived long ago.</span><br>

							<span>He defied the yellow-bristled Horseman of Ye.</span><br>
							<span>Fighting single- handed for a thousand miles,</span><br>
							<span>With his naked dagger he could hold a multitude.</span><br>
							<span>...Granted that the troops of China were as swift as heaven's thunder</span><br>
							<span>And that Tartar soldiers perished in pitfalls fanged with iron,</span><br>
							<span>General Wei Qing's victory was only a thing of chance.</span><br>
							<span>And General Li Guang's thwarted effort was his fate, not his fault.</span><br>
							<span>Since this man's retirement he is looking old and worn:</span><br>
							<span>Experience of the world has hastened his white hairs.</span><br>
							<span>Though once his quick dart never missed the right eye of a bird,</span><br>
							<span>Now knotted veins and tendons make his left arm like an osier.</span><br>
							<span>He is sometimes at the road-side selling melons from his garden,</span><br>
							<span>He is sometimes planting willows round his hermitage.</span><br>
							<span>His lonely lane is shut away by a dense grove,</span><br>
							<span>His vacant window looks upon the far cold mountains</span><br>
							<span>But, if he prayed, the waters would come gushing for his men</span><br>
							<span>And never would he wanton his cause away with wine.</span><br>

							<span>In the three River Provinces, the governors call young men -- </span><br>
							<span>And five imperial edicts have summoned the old general.</span><br>
							<span>So he dusts his iron coat and shines it like snow - </span><br>
							<span>Waves his dagger from its jade hilt in a dance of starry steel.</span><br>
							<span>He is ready with his strong northern bow to smite the Tartar chieftain --</span><br>
							<span>That never a foreign war-dress may affront the Emperor.</span><br>
							<span>...There once was an aged Prefect, forgotten and far away,</span><br>

							<span>Forty-eight thousand years had passed</span><br>
							<span>With nobody arriving across the Qin border.</span><br>
							<span>And the Great White Mountain, westward, still has only a bird's path</span><br>
							<span>Up to the summit of Emei Peak --</span><br>
							<span>Which was broken once by an earthquake and there were brave men lost,</span><br>

							<span>Then, holding our chests with our hands and sinking to the ground with a groan,</span><br>
							<span>We wonder if this westward trail will never have an end.</span><br>
