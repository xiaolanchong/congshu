<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of
his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in
the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner
saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her
towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast room, and
congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy
prospect of their nearer connection.  Mr. Collins received and
returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with
the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be
satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly
given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the
genuine delicacy of her character.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">柯林斯先生独自一个人默默地幻想着美满的姻<BR>
缘，可是并没有想上多久，因为班纳特太太一<BR>
直待在走廊里混时间，等着听他们俩商谈煌结<BR>
果，现在看见伊丽莎白开了门，匆匆忙忙走上<BR>
楼去，她便马上走进饭厅，热烈地祝贺柯林斯<BR>
先生，祝贺她自己，说是他们今后大有亲上加<BR>
亲的希望了。柯林斯先生同样快乐地接受了她<BR>
的祝贺，同时又祝贺了她一番，接着就把他跟<BR>
伊丽莎白刚才的那场谈话，一五一十地讲了出<BR>
来，说他有充分的理由相信，谈话的结果很令<BR>
人满意，因为他的表妹虽然再三拒绝，可是那<BR>
种拒绝，自然是她那羞怯淑静和娇柔细致的天<BR>
性的流露。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; -- she would
have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had
meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but
she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这一消息可叫班纳特太太吓了一跳。当然，要<BR>
是她的女儿果真是口头上拒绝分的求婚，骨子<BR>
里却在鼓励他，那她也会同样觉得高兴的，可<BR>
是她不敢这么想，而且不得不照直说了出来。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall
be brought to reason.  I will speak to her about it myself
directly.  She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not
know her own interest; but I will <I>make</I> her know it."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她说：“柯林斯先生，你放心吧，我会叫丽萃<BR>
懂事一些的。我马上就要亲自跟她谈谈。她是<BR>
个固执的傻姑娘，不明白好歹；可是我会叫她<BR>
明白的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr. Collins;
"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not
whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man
in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the
marriage state.  If therefore she actually persists in
rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into
accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she
could not contribute much to my felicity."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“对不起，让我插句嘴，太太，”柯林斯先生<BR>
叫道：“要是她果真又固执又傻，那我就不知<BR>
道她是否配做我理想的妻子了，因为象我这样<BR>
地位的人，结婚自然是为了要幸福。这么说，<BR>
如果她真拒绝我的求婚，那倒是不要勉强她好<BR>
，否则，她脾气方面有了这些缺点，她对于我<BR>
的幸福决不会不什么好处。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.  In every
thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived.  I will
go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it
with her, I am sure."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太吃惊地说：“先生，你完全误会了<BR>
我的意思，丽萃不过在这类事情上固执些，可<BR>
是遇到别的事情，她的性子再好也没有了。我<BR>
马上去找班纳特先生，我们一下子就会把她这<BR>
个问题谈妥的，我有把握。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to
her husband, called out as she entered the library,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她不等他回答，便急忙跑到丈夫那儿去，一走<BR>
进他的书房就嚷道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an
uproar.  You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for
she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he
will change his mind and not have <I>her</I>."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢，我的好老爷，你得马上出来一下；我们<BR>
闹得天翻地覆了呢。你得来劝劝丽萃跟柯林斯<BR>
先生结婚，因为她赌咒发誓不要他；假如你不<BR>
赶快来打个圆场，他就要改变主意，反过来不<BR>
要她了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and
fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in
the least altered by her communication.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特先生见她走进来，便从书本上抬起眼睛<BR>
，安然自得、漠不关心地望着她脸上。他听了<BR>
她的话，完全不动声色。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he,
when she had finished her speech.  "Of what are you talking?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她说完以后，他便说道：“抱歉，我没有听懂<BR>
你究竟说些什么。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.  Lizzy declares she will not have
Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not
have Lizzy."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我说的是柯林斯先生和丽萃的事，丽萃表示<BR>
不要柯林斯先生，柯林斯先生也开始说他不要<BR>
丽萃了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And what am I to do on the occasion? -- It seems an hopeless
business."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这种事叫我有什么办法？看来是件没有指望<BR>
贩事。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.  Tell her that you insist
upon her marrying him."

跟她结婚不可。”<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Let her be called down.  She shall hear my opinion."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“叫她下来吧。让我来跟她说。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to
the library.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太拉下了铃，伊丽莎白小姐给叫到书<BR>
房里来了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.  "I have
sent for you on an affair of importance.  I understand that Mr.
Collins has made you an offer of marriage.  Is it true?"
Elizabeth replied that it was.  "Very well -- and this offer of
marriage you have refused?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">爸爸一见她来，便大声说：“上这儿来，孩子<BR>
，我叫你来谈一件要紧的事。我听说柯林斯先<BR>
生向你求婚，真有这回事吗？”伊丽莎白说，<BR>
真有这回事。“很好。你把这桩婚事回绝了吗<BR>
？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I have, Sir."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我回绝了，爸爸。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Very well.  We now come to the point.  Your mother insists
upon your accepting it.  Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“很好，我们现在就来谈到本题。你的妈非要<BR>
你答应不可。我的好太太，可不是吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, or I will never see her again."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“是的，否则我看也不要看到她了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.  From this
day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. -- Your
mother will never see you again if you do <I>not</I> marry Mr.
Collins, and I will never see you again if you <I>do</I>."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“摆在你面前的是个很不幸的难题，你得自己<BR>
去抉择，伊丽莎白。从今天起，你不和父亲成<BR>
为陌路人，就要和母亲成为陌路人。要是你不<BR>
嫁给柯林斯先生，你的妈就不要再见你，要是<BR>
你嫁给他，我就不要再见你了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a
beginning; but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her
husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively
disappointed.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白听到了那样的开头和这样的结论，不<BR>
得不笑了一笑；不过，这可苦了班纳特太太，<BR>
她本以为丈夫一定会照着她的意思来对待这件<BR>
事的，哪里料到反而叫她大失所望。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你这话是什么意思，我的好老爷？你事先不<BR>
是答应了我，非叫她嫁给他不可吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to
request.  First, that you will allow me the free use of my
understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my
room.  I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as
may be."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“好太太，”丈夫回答道，“我有两件事要求<BR>
你帮帮忙。第一，请你允许我自由运用我自己<BR>
的书房。我真巴不得早日在自己书房里图个清<BR>
闲自在。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her
husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point.  She talked to
Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest but Jane with
all possible mildness declined interfering; -- and Elizabeth,
sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful
gaiety, replied to her attacks.  Though her manner varied,
however, her determination never did.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太虽然碰了一鼻子灰，可是并不甘心<BR>
罢休。她一遍又一遍地说服伊丽莎白，一忽儿<BR>
哄骗，一忽儿威胁。她想尽办法拉着吉英帮忙<BR>
，可是吉英偏不愿意多管闲事，极其委婉地谢<BR>
绝了。伊丽莎白应付得很好，一忽儿情意恳切<BR>
，一忽儿又是嘻皮笑脸，方式尽管变来变换去<BR>
，决心却始终如一。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had
passed.  He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what
motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was
hurt, he suffered in no other way.  His regard for her was
quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her
mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这当儿，柯林斯先生独自把刚才的那一幕深思<BR>
默想了一番。他的把自己估价太高了，因此弄<BR>
不明白表妹所以拒绝他，原因究竟何在。虽说<BR>
他的自尊心受到了伤害，可是他别的方面丝毫<BR>
也不觉得难过。他对他的好感完全是凭空想象<BR>
的，他又以为她的母亲一定会责骂她，因此心<BR>
里便也不觉得有什么难受了，因为她挨她母亲<BR>
的骂是活该，不必为她过意不去。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came
to spend the day with them.  She was met in the vestibule by
Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad
you are come, for there is such fun here! -- What do you think
has happened this morning? -- Mr. Collins has made an offer to
Lizzy, and she will not have him."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">正当这一家子闹得乱纷纷的时候，夏绿蒂・卢<BR>
卡斯上她们这儿来玩了。丽迪雅在大门品碰到<BR>
她，立刻奔上前去凑近她跟前说道：“你来了<BR>
我真高兴，这儿正闹得有趣呢！你知道今天上<BR>
午发生了什么事？柯林斯先生向丽萃求婚，丽<BR>
萃偏偏不肯要他。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by
Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they
entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than
she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for
her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy
to comply with the wishes of all her family.  "Pray do, my dear
Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on
my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody
feels for my poor nerves."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">夏绿蒂还没来得及回答，吉蒂就走到她们跟前<BR>
来了，把同样的消息报道了一遍。她们走进起<BR>
坐间，只见班纳特太太正独自待在那儿，马上<BR>
又和她们谈到这话题上来，要求卢卡斯小姐怜<BR>
恤怜恤她老人家，劝劝她的朋友丽萃顺从全家<BR>
人的意思。“求求你吧，卢卡斯小姐，”她又<BR>
用苦痛的声调说道：“谁也不站在我一边，大<BR>
家都故意作践我，一个个都对我狠心透顶，谁<BR>
也不能体谅我的神经。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and
Elizabeth.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">夏绿蒂正要回答，恰巧吉英和伊丽莎白走进来<BR>
了，因此没有开口。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as
unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we
were at York, provided she can have her own way. -- But I tell
you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on
refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never
get a husband at all -- and I am sure I do not know who is to
maintain you when your father is dead. -- <I>I</I> shall not be able
to keep you -- and so I warn you. -- I have done with you from
this very day. -- I told you in the library, you know, that
I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good
as my word.  I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful
children, -- Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to
any body.  People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking.  Nobody can tell
what I suffer! -- But it is always so.  Those who do not
complain are never pitied."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“嘿，她来啦，”班纳特太太接下去说。“看<BR>
她一脸满不在乎的神气，一些不把我们放在心<BR>
上，好象是冤家对头，一任她自己独断独行。<BR>
──丽萃小姐，让我老实告诉你吧；如果你一<BR>
碰到人家求婚，就象这样拒绝，那你一生一世<BR>
都休想弄到一个丈夫。瞧你爸爸去世以后，还<BR>
有谁来养你。我是养不活你的，事先得跟你声<BR>
明。从今天起，我跟你一刀两断。你知道，刚<BR>
刚在书房里，我就跟你说过，我再也不要跟你<BR>
说话了瞧我说得到就做得到。我不高兴跟忤逆<BR>
的女儿说话。老实说，跟谁说话都不大乐意。<BR>
象我这样一个神经上有病痛的人，就没有多大<BR>
的兴致说话。谁也不知道我的苦楚！不过天下<BR>
事总是这样的，你嘴上不诉苦，就没有人可怜<BR>
你。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible
that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only
increase the irritation.  She talked on, therefore, without
interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr.
Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and
on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">女儿们一声不响，只是听着她发牢骚。她们都<BR>
明白，要是你想跟她评评理，安慰安慰她，那<BR>
就等于火上加油。她唠唠叨叨往下说，女儿们<BR>
没有一个来岔断她的话。最后，柯林斯先生进<BR>
来了，脸上的神气比平常显得益发庄严，她一<BR>
见到他，便对女儿们这样说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your
tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation
together."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“现在我要你们一个个都住嘴，让柯林斯先生<BR>
跟我谈一会儿。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty
followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all
she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of
Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family
were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied
herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.
In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected
conversation. -- "Oh!  Mr. Collins!" --
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白静悄悄地走出去了，吉英和吉蒂跟着<BR>
也走了出去，只有丽迪雅站在那儿不动，正要<BR>
听听他们谈些什么。夏绿蒂也没有走，先是因<BR>
为柯林斯先生仔仔细细问候她和她的家庭，所<BR>
以不便即走，随后又为了满足她自己的好奇心<BR>
，便走到窗口，去偷听他们谈话。只听得班纳<BR>
特太太开始怨声怨气地把预先准备好的一番话<BR>
谈出来：“哦，柯林斯先生。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this
point.  Far be it from me," he presently continued, in a voice
that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your
daughter.  Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us
all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate
as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive
happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value
in our estimation.  You will not, I hope, consider me as
showing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus
withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without
having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of
requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.  My
conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.  But
we are all liable to error.  I have certainly meant well
through the whole affair.  My object has been to secure an
amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the
advantage of all your family, and if my <I>manner</I> has been at
all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“亲爱的太太，”柯林斯先生说，“这件事让<BR>
我们再也别提了吧。我决不会怨恨令嫒这种行<BR>
为。”他说到这里，声调中立刻流露出极其不<BR>
愉快的意味：“我们大家都得逆来顺受，象我<BR>
这样年少得志，小小年纪就得到了人家的器重<BR>
，特别应该如此，我相信我一切都听天由命。<BR>
即使蒙我那位美丽的表妹不弃，答应了我的求<BR>
婚，或许我仍然免不了要怀疑，是否就此会获<BR>
得真正的幸福，因为我一向认为，幸福一经拒<BR>
绝，就不值得我们再加重视。遇到这种场合，<BR>
听天由命是再好不过的办法。亲爱的太太，我<BR>
这样收回了对令嫒的求婚，希望你别以为这是<BR>
对您老人家和班纳特先生不恭敬的表示，别怪<BR>
我没要求你们出面代我调停一下。只不过我并<BR>
不是受到您拒绝，而是受到令嫒的拒绝，这一<BR>
点也许值得遗憾。可是人人都难免有个阴错阳<BR>
差的时候。我对于这件事始终是一片好心好意<BR>
。我的目的就是要找一个可爱的伴侣，并且适<BR>
当地考虑到府上的利益；假使我的态度方面有<BR>
什么地方应该受到责备的话，就让我当面道个<BR>
谦吧。”<BR></TD>
