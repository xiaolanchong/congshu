       Well,    I   visited  their   website  and  read up  on   what   they   do.    They're an  IT service company   that   offers   comprehensive  business solutions    for   large   corporations.    They    provide   services  such as   CRM  development,    and   they  also   offer   custom-designed  applications.

       Well,    as I said  they're    the   industry leaders,   they   have   a   really     great   growth strategy,    amazing  development opportunities   for   employees,   and   it  seems like   they   have     strong    corporate governance.   They're   all about  helping  companies  grow  and     unleashing  potential.     I   guess   their   core values  and   mission  really   resonated  with   me.    Oh,    and   they   offer   six  weeks'   vacation,   stock options  and   bonuses... I'm   totally  going to cash in  on   that.
