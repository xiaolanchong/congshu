<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of
nature had been but little assisted by education or society;
the greatest part of his life having been spent under the
guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he
belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the
necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.
The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given
him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and
unexpected prosperity.  A fortunate chance had recommended him
to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was
vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his
veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good
opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his
rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and
obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

十分严厉，因此他的为人本来很是谦卑，不过<BR>
他本是个蠢材，现在生活又过得很优闲，当然<BR>
不免自高自大，何况年纪轻轻就发了意外之财<BR>
，更其自视甚高，哪里还谈得上谦卑。当时汉<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended
to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn
family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the
daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they
were represented by common report.  This was his plan of amends
-- of atonement -- for inheriting their father's estate; and he
thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his
own part.

face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest
notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening
she was his settled choice.  The next morning, however, made an
alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with
Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his
parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his
hopes that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn,
produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed
on. -- "As to her <I>younger</I> daughters she could not take upon
her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did
not <I>know</I> of any prepossession; -- her <I>eldest</I> daughter, she
must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was
likely to be very soon engaged."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten;
every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins
was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most
anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for
thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there
he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest
folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet,
with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.
Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.  In his library
he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though
prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit
in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from
them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in
inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and
Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than
a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book,
and go.

his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.  The
attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained

street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very
smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window,
could recall them.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,
whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike
appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the
way.  The officer was the very Mr. Denny, concerning whose
return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they
passed.  All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered
who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to
find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just
gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had
reached the same spot.  Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and
entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who
had returned with him the day before from town, and he was
happy to say, had accepted a commission in their corps.  This
was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only
regimentals to make him completely charming.  His appearance
was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty
-- a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing
address.  The introduction was followed up on his side by a
happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time
perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were
still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the
sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street.  On distinguishing the ladies of
the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
began the usual civilities.  Bingley was the principal
spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.  He was then,
he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after
her.  Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning
to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were
suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each
other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.  Both
changed colour, one looked white, the other red.  Mr. Wickham,
after a few moments, touched his hat -- a salutation which Mr.
Darcy just deigned to return.  What could be the meaning of it?
-- It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long
to know.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two
eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome,
and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden
return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them,
she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to
see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that
they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because
the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.  She
received him with her very best politeness, which he returned
with as much more, apologising for his intrusion without any
previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help
flattering himself, however, might be justified by his
relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her
notice.  Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an
end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom,
however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew,
that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to
have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire.  She had been
watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down
the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would
certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one
passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in
comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable
fellows."  Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on
Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family
from Longbourn would come in the evening.  This was agreed to,
and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice
comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of
hot supper afterwards.  The prospect of such delights was very
cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.  Mr. Collins
repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.
