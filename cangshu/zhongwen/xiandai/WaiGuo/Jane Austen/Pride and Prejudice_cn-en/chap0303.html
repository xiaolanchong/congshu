<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of
her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how
very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and
was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side
the acquaintance would now be renewed.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白现在认为，彬格莱小姐所以一向厌恶<BR>
她，原因不外乎和她吃醋。她既然有了这种想<BR>
法，便不禁觉得这次到彭伯里去，彬格莱小姐<BR>
一定不会欢迎她；尽管如此，她倒想看看这一<BR>
次旧雨重逢，那位小姐是否会多少顾全一些大<BR>
体。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into
the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for
summer.  Its windows, opening to the ground, admitted a most
refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and
of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered
over the intermediate lawn.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">到了彭伯里的大厦，家人们就带着她们走过穿<BR>
堂，进入客厅，只见客厅北面景色非常动人，<BR>
窗户外边是一片空地，屋后树林茂密，岗峦耸<BR>
叠，草地上种满了美丽的橡树和西班牙栗树，<BR>
真是好一派爽心悦目的夏日风光。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting
there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom
she lived in London.  Georgiana's reception of them was very
civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though
proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would
easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of
her being proud and reserved.  Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,
however, did her justice, and pitied her.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西小姐在这间屋子里接待她们，跟她一同来<BR>
接她们的还有赫斯脱太太、彬格莱小姐，以及<BR>
那位在伦敦跟达西小姐住在一起的太太。乔治<BR>
安娜对她们礼貌非常周全，只是态度颇不自然<BR>
，这固然是因为她有几分羞怯，生怕有失礼的<BR>
地方，可是在那些自以为身份比她低的人看来<BR>
，便容易误会她为人傲慢矜持，幸亏嘉丁纳太<BR>
太和她外甥女决不会错怪她反而还同情她。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a
curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such
pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.  It was
first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable looking
woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse
proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help
from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.  Miss Darcy
looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and
sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least
danger of its being heard.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">赫斯脱太太和彬格莱小姐只对她们行了个屈膝<BR>
礼。她们坐定以后，宾主之间许久不曾交谈，<BR>
实在别扭。后来还是安涅斯雷太太第一个开口<BR>
说话。这位太太是个和蔼可亲的大家闺秀，你<BR>
只要瞧她竭力想出话来攀谈，便可以知道她确<BR>
实比另外两位有教养得多。全靠她同嘉丁纳太<BR>
太先攀谈起来，再加上伊丽莎白不时地插几句<BR>
嘴助助兴，谈话才算没有冷场。达西小姐好象<BR>
想说话而又缺乏勇气，只是趁着人家听不见的<BR>
时候支吾一两声，也总算难得。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss
Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to
Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.  This observation
would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter,
had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she
was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.  Her
own thoughts were employing her.  She expected every moment
that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.  She wished,
she feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them;
and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely
determine.  After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour
without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by
receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her
family.  She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and
the other said no more.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白立刻发觉彬格莱小姐在仔细地看着她<BR>
，注意她的一言一语，特别注意她跟达西小姐<BR>
攀谈。如果伊丽莎白跟达西小姐座位隔得很近<BR>
，攀谈起来很方便，她决不会因为畏忌彬格莱<BR>
小姐而就不和达西小姐攀谈，可是既然毋须多<BR>
谈，再加她自己也正心思重重，所以也并不觉<BR>
得遗憾。她时时刻刻都盼望着男客们一同进来<BR>
，可是她虽然盼望，却又害怕，她究竟是盼望<BR>
得迫切，还是害怕得厉害，她自己也几乎说不<BR>
上来。伊丽莎白就这样坐了一刻钟之久，没有<BR>
听到彬格莱小姐发表一言半语，后来忽然之间<BR>
吓了一跳，原来是彬格莱小姐冷冰冰地问候她<BR>
家里人的安好。她也同样冷冷谈谈简简单单地<BR>
敷衍了她几句，对方便也就不再开口。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by
the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of
all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place
till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley
to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.  There
was now employment for the whole party; for though they could
not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of
grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the
table.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她们来了不久，佣人们便送来了冷肉、点心、<BR>
以及各种应时鲜果。本来达西小姐一直忘了叫<BR>
人端来，幸亏安涅斯雷太太频频向她做着眼色<BR>
，装着微笑，方才提醒了她做主人的责任。这<BR>
一下大家都有事情可做了。虽然不是每个人都<BR>
健谈，可是每个人都会吃；大家一看见那大堆<BR>
大堆美丽的葡萄、油桃和桃子，一下子就聚拢<BR>
来围着桌子坐下。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of
deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance
of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering
the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed
her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吃东西的时候，达西先生走了进来，伊丽莎白<BR>
便趁此辨别一下自己的心情，究竟是希望他在<BR>
场，还是害怕他在场。辨别的结果，虽然自以<BR>
为盼望的心情多于害怕的心情，可是他进来了<BR>
不到一分钟，她却又认为他还是不进来的好。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three
other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and
had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family
intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.  No sooner did he
appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and
unembarrassed; -- a resolution the more necessary to be made,
but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the
suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and
that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his
behaviour when he first came into the room.  In no countenance
was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss
Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face
whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not
yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by
no means over.  Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted
herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was
anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and
forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation
on either side.  Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in
the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying,
with sneering civility,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">且说达西原先同自己家里两三个人陪着嘉丁纳<BR>
先生在河边钓鱼，后来一听到嘉丁纳太太和她<BR>
外甥女当天上午就要来拜望乔治安娜，便立刻<BR>
离开了他们，回到家里来。伊丽莎白见他走进<BR>
来，便临机应变，下定决心，促使自己千万要<BR>
表现得从容不迫，落落大方。她下定这个决心<BR>
，确实很必要，只可惜事实上不大容易做到，<BR>
因为她看到全场的人都在怀疑他们俩；达西一<BR>
走进来，几乎没有一只眼睛不在注意着他的举<BR>
止。虽然人人都有好奇心，可是谁也不象彬格<BR>
莱小姐那么露骨，她在她对他们两人中间随便<BR>
哪一个谈起话来，还是满面笑容，这是因为她<BR>
还没有嫉妒到不择手段的地步，也没有对达西<BR>
先生完全死心。达西小姐看见哥哥来了，便尽<BR>
量多说话；伊丽莎白看出达西极其盼望她跟他<BR>
妹妹处熟起来，他还尽量促进她们双方多多攀<BR>
谈。彬格莱小姐把这些情形看不眼里，很是气<BR>
愤，也就顾不得唐突，顾不得礼貌，一有机会<BR>
便冷言冷语地说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed
from Meryton?  They must be a great loss to <I>your</I> family."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“请问你，伊丽莎白小姐，麦里屯的民兵团不<BR>
是开走了吗？府上一定觉得这是一个很大的损<BR>
失吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name;
but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in
her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him
gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously
to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the
question in a tolerably disengaged tone.  While she spoke,
an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome
with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes.  Had Miss
Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend,
she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had
merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward
the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her
betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion,
and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps.  Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss
Darcy's meditated elopement.  To no creature had it been
revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and
from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly
anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had
long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her
own.  He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning
that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his
lively concern for the welfare of his friend.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她只是不敢当着达西的面明目张胆地提起韦翰<BR>
的名字，可是伊丽莎白立刻懂得她指的就是那<BR>
个人，因此不禁想起过去跟他的一些来往，一<BR>
时感到难过。这是一种恶意的攻击，伊丽莎白<BR>
非要狠狠地还击她一下不可，于是她立刻用一<BR>
种满不在乎的声调回答了她那句话。她一面说<BR>
，一面不由自主地对达西望了一眼，只见达西<BR>
涨红了脸，恳切地望着她，达西的妹妹更是万<BR>
分慌张，低头无语。彬格莱小姐如果早知道这<BR>
种不三不四的话会使得她自己的意中人这样苦<BR>
痛，她自然就决不会说出中了。她只是存心要<BR>
打乱伊丽莎白的心思，她以为伊丽莎白过去曾<BR>
倾心于那个男人，便故意说了出来，便她出出<BR>
丑，让达西看不起她甚至还可以让达西想起她<BR>
几个妹妹曾经为了那个民兵团闹出多少荒唐的<BR>
笑话。至于达西小姐想要私奔的事情，她一点<BR>
也不知情，因为达西先生对这件事一向尽量保<BR>
守秘密，除了伊丽莎白小姐以外，没有向任何<BR>
人透露过。她对彬格莱的亲友们隐瞒得特别小<BR>
心，因为他认为以后要和他们攀亲，这也是伊<BR>
丽莎白意料中的事。他的确早就有了这个找算<BR>
；也许就是为了这个原因，便对彬格莱的幸福<BR>
更加关心，可并不是因此而千方百计地拆散彬<BR>
格莱和班纳特小姐的好事。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his
emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not
approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time,
though not enough to be able to speak any more.  Her brother,
whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest
in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been
designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西看到伊丽莎白不动声色，方才安下心来。<BR>
彬格莱小姐苦恼失望之余，不敢再提到韦翰，<BR>
于是乔治安娜也很快恢复了正常的神态，只不<BR>
过一时之间还不好意思开口说话。她害怕看到<BR>
她哥哥的眼睛，事实上她哥哥倒没有留意她也<BR>
牵涉在这件事情里面。彬格莱小姐这次本来已<BR>
经安排好神机妙算，要使得达西回心转意，不<BR>
再眷恋伊丽莎白，结果反而使他对伊丽莎白更<BR>
加念念难忘，更加有情意。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Their visit did not continue long after the question and
answer above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending
them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings
in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.
But Georgiana would not join her.  Her brother's recommendation
was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err,
and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave
Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable.  When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss
Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she
had been saying to his sister.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这一问一答以后，客人们没有隔多久就告辞了<BR>
。当达西先生送她们上马车的时候，彬格莱小<BR>
姐便趁机在他妹妹面前大发牢骚，把伊丽莎白<BR>
的人品、举止和服装都一一编派到了。乔治安<BR>
娜可并没有接嘴，因为她哥哥既然那么推崇伊<BR>
丽莎白，她当然便也对她有了好感。哥哥的看<BR>
法决不会错；他把伊丽莎白捧得叫乔治安娜只<BR>
觉得她又亲切又可爱。达西回到客厅里来的时<BR>
候，彬格莱小姐又把刚才跟他妹妹说的话，重<BR>
新又说了一遍给他听。她大声说道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she
cried; "I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she
is since the winter.  She is grown so brown and coarse!  Louisa
and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“达西先生，今天上午伊丽莎・班纳特小姐的<BR>
脸色多难看！从去年冬天以来，她真变得太厉<BR>
害了，我一辈子也没看见过哪个人象她这样。<BR>
她的皮肤变得又黑又粗糙，露薏莎和我简直不<BR>
认识她了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address,
he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no
other alteration than her being rather tanned -- no miraculous
consequence of travelling in the summer.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这种话尽管不投合达西的心意，他却还是冷冷<BR>
地敷衍了她一下，说是他看不出她有什么变化<BR>
，只不过皮肤黑了一点，这是夏天旅行的结果<BR>
，不足为奇。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never
could see any beauty in her.  Her face is too thin; her
complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all
handsome.  Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in
its lines.  Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common
way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so
fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them.
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all;
and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without
fashion which is intolerable."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱小姐回答道：“老实说，我觉得根本看<BR>
不出她有什么美。她的脸太瘦，皮肤没有光泽<BR>
，眉目也不清秀。她的鼻子也不过普普通通；<BR>
讲到她的眼睛，人家有时候都把它说得多么美<BR>
，我可看不出有什么大不了。她那双眼睛有些<BR>
尖刻相，又有些恶毒相，我才不喜欢呢；而且<BR>
拿她的整个风度来说，完全是自命不凡，其实<BR>
却不登大雅之堂，真叫人受不了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth,
this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry
people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look
somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.  He was
resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making
him speak she continued,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱小姐既然早已拿定主意达西受上了伊丽<BR>
莎白，又要用这种办法来搏得他的喜欢，实在<BR>
不太高明；不过人们在一时气愤之下，往往难<BR>
免有失算的时候。她看到达西终于给弄得多少<BR>
有些神色烦恼，便自以为如意算盘打成功了。<BR>
达西却咬紧牙关，一声不，响；她为了非要他<BR>
说几句话不可，便又往下说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how
amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and
I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had
been dining at Netherfield, ``<I>She</I> a beauty! -- I should as
soon call her mother a wit.''  But afterwards she seemed to
improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我还记得我们第一次在哈福德郡认识她的时<BR>
候，听人家说她是个有名的美人儿，我们都觉<BR>
得十分奇怪；我特别记得有一个晚上，她们在<BR>
尼日斐花园吃过晚饭以后，你说：‘她也算得<BR>
上一个美人！那么她妈妈也算得上一个天才了<BR>
！’可是你以后就对她印象她起来了，你也有<BR>
一个时期觉得她很好看。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer,
"but <I>that</I> was only when I first knew her, for it is many
months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest
women of my acquaintance."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西真是忍无可忍了，只得回答道：“话是说<BR>
得不错，可是，那是我刚认识她的时候的事情<BR>
；最近好几个月以来，我已经把她看做我认识<BR>
的女朋友当中最漂亮的一个。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the
satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one
any pain but herself.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他这样说过以后，便走开了，只剩下彬格莱小<BR>
姐一个人。她逼着他说出了这几句话，本以为<BR>
可以借此得意一番，结果只落得自讨没趣。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred
during their visit, as they returned, except what had
particularly interested them both.  The looks and behaviour of
every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person
who had mostly engaged their attention.  They talked of his
sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but
himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner
thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly
gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳太太和伊丽莎白回到寓所以后，便把这<BR>
次作客所遇到的种种事情详细谈论了一番，只<BR>

头论足，又一一谈到各人的神情举止，只可惜<BR>
她们特别留意的那个人却没有谈到。她们谈到<BR>
了他的妹妹、他的朋友、他的住宅、他请客人<BR>
