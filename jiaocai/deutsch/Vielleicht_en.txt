[Chorus: JBS]
And maybe, maybe, maybe
You sometimes think of me too
Give us time, give us time
Before my world breaks apart inside of you
And maybe, maybe, maybe
You sometimes think of me too
Give us time, give us time
Before my world breaks apart inside of you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1: MilleniumKid]
And you say you think of me
The lie marks your face
And a part inside me dies
Because you don't even miss me
Please go, go far away
And take the chaos away from me
Crushed by burdens, breathing heavy
Yet I'm drowning in a sea of tears

[Bridge: JBS]
(Before my world falls apart)
(Before my world falls apart)

[Verse 2: MilleniumKid]
When will this pain finally fade?
Finally burn away, only embers remain
A pile of ashes scattered in the wind
Nothing left of me at all
Please go, go far away
And take the chaos away from me
And my heart, it screams for you
Because I can't let go

[Chorus: JBS]
And maybe, maybe, maybe
You sometimes think of me too
Give us time, give us time
Before my world breaks apart inside of you

[Outro: JBS]
(Before my world falls apart)
(Before my world falls apart)
