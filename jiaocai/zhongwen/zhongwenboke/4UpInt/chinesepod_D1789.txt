Upper-Intermediate - The Seven Year Itch 2: Facing Divorce

(D1789)

A:

你怎么才回来？打你电话也不接！

nǐ zěnme cái huílai? dǎ nǐ diànhuà yě bù jiē!

How are you just getting back now? You didn't answer your phone either!

B:

电话放包里没听见啊！你这么大声干什么？你不怕吓着孩子！

diànhuà fàng bāo lǐ méi tīngjiàn a! nǐ zhème dàshēng gàn shénme? nǐ bù pà xiàzháo háizi!

I had my phone in my bag so I didn't hear it! What are you doing yelling at me like that? You're going to scare the child!

A:

你还管孩子啊！孩子哇哇大哭吵着要妈妈，你倒好，下班两个多小时了才到家。

nǐ hái guǎn háizi a! háizi wāwā dàkū chǎo zhe yào māma, nǐ dào hǎo, xiàbān liǎng gè duō xiǎoshí le cái dào jiā.

As if you care about the kid! They were crying and shouting for their mother, but you, you come home more than two hours after getting off work.

B:

不是跟你说了嘛，最近公司比较忙，晚上要加一会儿班。

bùshì gēn nǐ shuō le ma, zuìjìn gōngsī bǐjiào máng, wǎnshang yào jiā yīhuǐr bān.

Haven't I told you? Work has been busy recently. I have to work overtime a bit during the evening.

A:

什么破工作，辞了算了。

shénme pò gōngzuò, cí le suànle.

What a lousy job. Just quit and forget about it.

B:

说得倒好听。辞了工作你养我们娘儿俩啊！你养得起吗？

shuōde dào hǎotīng. cí le gōngzuò nǐ yǎng wǒmen niángr liǎ a! nǐ yǎngdeqǐ ma?

That sounds great. Quit my job so you can support me and the kid! Could you handle it?

A:

我怎么就养不起了？

wǒ zěnme jiù yǎngbuqǐ le?

Why wouldn't I be able to handle it?

B:

好了好了，我累了，不想跟你吵。

hǎole hǎole, wǒ lèi le, bù xiǎng gēn nǐ chǎo.

OK, OK. I'm tired. I don't want to argue with you.

A:

谁愿意跟你吵。

shéi yuànyì gēn nǐ chǎo.

Who would want to argue with you?

A:

喂。

wéi.

Hello.

C:

是我，江涛！

shì wǒ, Jiāngtāo!

Yes, it's me, Jiang Tao!

A:

江涛啊！好久没联系了！

Jiāngtāo a! hǎo jiǔ méi liánxì le!

We haven't talked in ages, Jiang Tao!

C:

是啊。我最近在闹离婚，郁闷得不行，哪天有空出来陪我喝两杯。

shì a. wǒ zuìjìn zài nào líhūn, yùmèn de bùxíng, nǎtiān yǒukòng chūlai péi wǒ hē liǎng bēi.

Yeah. I'm facing a divorce. I'm really depressed. You should come out and have a drink with me when you get a chance.

A:

啊？什么时候的事？

ǎ? shénme shíhou de shì?

What? When did this happen?

C:

都闹了半年了。老早就分居了。闹心。一直也没跟哥们儿说过。有时候想，离了也好，离了就清静了。

dōu nào le bàn nián le. lǎozǎo jiù fēnjū le. nàoxīn. yīzhí yě méi gēn gēmenr shuō guo. yǒushíhou xiǎng, lí le yěhǎo, lí le jiù qīngjìng le.

It's been going on for half a year now. We've been living apart for a while. It's awful. I haven't told any of my guy friends about it. Sometimes I feel like getting a divorce will be a good thing, that it'll just be quiet after.

A:

怎么搞的啊！你们俩风风雨雨这么多年了，一起创业什么的，不是挺好的吗？

zěnmegǎode a! nǐmen liǎ fēngfēngyǔyǔ zhème duō nián le, yīqǐ chuàngyè shénme de, bùshì tǐng hǎo de ma?

How can this be? You two have been through so much all these years, started a business together and everything. Hasn't your relationship worked out great?

C:

可能我真的是太忙了，整天忙得跟个陀螺似的，忽略了她。她铁了心要跟我离，我估计是有别的男人追她吧！

kěnéng wǒ zhēnde shì tàimáng le, zhěngtiān máng de gēn ge tuóluó shìde, hūlǜe le tā. tā tiě le xīn yào gēn wǒ lí, wǒ gūjì shì yǒu biéde nánrén zhuī tā ba!

Perhaps I was too busy. Every day I was so busy I was just spinning around like a top. I neglected her. She's determined to divorce me. I think she has another man pursuing her!

A:

哎，女人啊，真不知道她们到底想要什么。

ài, nǚrén a, zhēn bù zhīdào tāmen dàodǐ xiǎngyào shénme.

Oh, women. It's really hard to know what they really want.

C:

幸好还没孩子，离了也没什么牵挂。

xìnghǎo hái méi háizi, lí le yě méi shénme qiānguà.

Fortunately we didn't have any kids so there's nothing to worry about once we divorce.

A:

哎，你们俩那么好，好得让人羡慕，要真离了太可惜了。再想想办法吧。

ài, nǐmen liǎ nàme hǎo, hǎo de ràngrén xiànmù, yào zhēn lí le tài kěxī le. zài xiǎng xiang bànfǎ ba.

Ah, you two are so great together. People really envy you two. If you really got a divorce it would be such a shame. You should try to think of another solution.

C:

没办法。离婚是一种病。可能真的是“七年之痒”吧！

méi bànfǎ. líhūn shì yīzhǒng bìng. kěnéng zhēnde shì" qīniánzhīyǎng” ba!

There's no solution. Divorce is a disease. Perhaps there really is such a thing as the "seven year itch!"
