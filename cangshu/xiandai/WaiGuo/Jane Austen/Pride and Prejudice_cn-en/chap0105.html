<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the
Bennets were particularly intimate.  Sir William Lucas had been
formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable
fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to
the King during his mayoralty.  The distinction had perhaps
been felt too strongly.  It had given him a disgust to his
business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas
Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own
importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely
in being civil to all the world.  For though elated by his
rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he
was all attention to every body.  By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made
him courteous.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">距离浪博恩不远的地方，住着一家人家，这就<BR>
是威廉・卢卡斯爵士府上。班纳特府上跟他们<BR>
特别知已。爵士从前是在麦里屯做生意起家发<BR>
迹的，曾在当市长的任内上书皇上，获得了一<BR>
个爵士头衔；这个显要的身份使他觉得太荣幸<BR>
，从此他就讨厌做生意，讨厌住在一个小镇上<BR>
，于是歇了生意，告别小镇，带着家属迁到那<BR>
离开麦里屯大约一英里路的一幢房子里去住，<BR>
从那时候起就把那地方叫做卢家庄。他可以在<BR>
这儿自得其乐，以显要自居，而且，既然摆脱<BR>
了生意的纠缠，他大可以一心一意地从事社交<BR>
活动。他尽管以自己的地位欣然自得，却并不<BR>
因此而目空一切，反而对什么人都应酬得非常<BR>
周到。他生来不肯得罪人，待人接物总是和蔼<BR>
可亲，殷勤体贴，而且自从皇上觐见以来，更<BR>
加彬彬有礼。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be
a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. -- They had several
children.  The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young
woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk
over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the
assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to
communicate.

Bingley's first choice."

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes; -- but he seemed to like his second better."

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh! -- you mean Jane, I suppose -- because he danced with her
twice.  To be sure that <I>did</I> seem as if he admired her --
indeed I rather believe he <I>did</I> -- I heard something about it
-- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“哦，我想你是说吉英吧，因为他跟她跳了两<BR>
次。看起来，他是真的爱上她呢──我的确相<BR>
信他是真的──我听到了一些话──可是我弄<BR>
不清究竟──我听到了一些有关鲁宾逊先生的<BR>
话。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.
Robinson; did not I mention it to you?  Mr. Robinson's asking
him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did
not think there were a great many pretty women in the room,
and <I>which</I> he thought the prettiest?  and his answering
immediately to the last question -- ``Oh!  the eldest Miss
Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that
point.''"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“说不定你指的是我喻听到他和鲁宾逊先生的<BR>
谈话吧；我不是跟你说过了吗？鲁宾逊先生问<BR>
他喜欢不喜欢我们麦里屯的跳舞会，问他是否<BR>
觉得到场的女宾们中间有许多人很美，问他认<BR>
为哪一个最美？他立刻回答了最后一个问题：<BR>
‘毫无问题是班纳特家的大小姐最美。关于这<BR>
一点，人们决不会有别的看法。’”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Upon my word! -- Well, that was very decided indeed --
that does seem as if -- but, however, it may all come to
nothing, you know."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“一定的！说起来，那的确成了定论啦──看<BR>
上去的确象是──不过，也许会全部落空呢，<BR>
你知道。”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"<I>My</I> overhearings were more to the purpose than <I>yours</I>,
Eliza," said Charlotte.  "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth
listening to as his friend, is he? -- Poor Eliza! -- to be
only just <I>tolerable</I>."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我偷听到的话比你听到的要更有意思了，伊<BR>
丽莎，”夏绿蒂说。“达西先生的话没有他朋<BR>
友的话中听，可不是吗？可怜的伊丽莎！他不<BR>
过认为她还可以！”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by
his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it
would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.  Mrs. Long
told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour
without once opening his lips."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我请求你别叫丽萃想起了他这种无礼的举动<BR>
又生起气来；他是那么讨厌的一个人，被他看<BR>

上他坐在她身边有半个钟头，可是始终不开口<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Are you quite sure, Ma'am? -- is not there a little mistake?"
said Jane. -- "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你的话靠得住吗，妈妈？──一点儿没说错<BR>
吗？”吉英说。“我清清楚楚看到达西先生跟<BR>
她说话的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield,
and he could not help answering her; -- but she said he seemed
very angry at being spoke to."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“嘿──那是后来她问起他喜欢不喜欢尼日斐<BR>
花园，他才不得不已敷衍了她一下；可是据她<BR>
说，他似乎非常生气，好象怪她不该跟她说话<BR>
似的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much
unless among his intimate acquaintance.  With <I>them</I> he is
remarkably agreeable."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“彬格莱小姐告诉我，”吉英说，“他从来不<BR>
爱多说话，除非跟知已的朋友们谈谈。他对待<BR>
知已朋友非常和蔼可亲。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.  If he had been so
very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.  But I can
guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride,
and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not
keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我跟本不相信这种话，要是他果真和蔼可亲<BR>
，就该跟郎格太太说话啦。可是这里面的奥妙<BR>
是可想而知的，大家都说他非常骄傲，他所以<BR>
没跟郎格太太说话，或许是因为听到朗格太太<BR>
连马车也没有一部，临时雇了车子来参加跳舞<BR>
会吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas,
"but I wish he had danced with Eliza."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他没跟郎格太太说话，我倒不计较，”卢卡<BR>
斯小姐说，“我只怪他当时没跟伊丽莎跳舞。<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with
<I>him</I>, if I were you."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“丽萃，假如我是你，”她母亲说，“我下次<BR>
偏不跟他跳舞。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you <I>never</I> to dance
with him."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“妈妈，我相信我可以万无一失地向你保证，<BR>
我怎么也不跟他跳舞呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend <I>me</I> so much
as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.  One
cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family,
fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of
himself.  If I may so express it, he has a <I>right</I> to be
proud."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他虽然骄傲，”卢卡斯小姐说，“可不象一<BR>
般人的骄傲那样使我生气，因为他的骄傲还勉<BR>
强说得过去。这么优秀的一个青年，门第好，<BR>
又有钱，样样都比人家强，也难怪他要自以为<BR>
了不起，照我的说法，他有权利骄傲。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily
forgive <I>his</I> pride, if he had not mortified <I>mine</I>."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这倒是真话，”伊丽莎白回答道，“要是他<BR>
没有触犯我的骄傲，我也很容易原谅他的骄傲<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of
her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe.  By all
that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common
indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that
there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of
self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or
imaginary.  Vanity and pride are different things, though the
words are often used synonymously.  A person may be proud
without being vain.  Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我以为骄傲是一般人的通病，”曼丽说。她<BR>
觉得自己的见解很高明，因此提高了谈话的兴<BR>
致。“从我所读过的许多书看来，我相信那的<BR>
确是非常普遍的一种通病，人性特别容易趋向<BR>
于这方面，简直谁都不免因为自己具有了某种<BR>
品质而自命不凡。虚荣与骄傲是截然不同的两<BR>
件事，尽管字面上常常当作同义词用，一个人<BR>
可以骄傲而不虚荣。骄傲多半不外乎我们对我<BR>
们自己的估价，虚荣却牵涉到我们希望别人对<BR>
我们的看法。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came
with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.  I would
keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every
day."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">卢家一个小哥儿（他是跟他姐姐们一起来的）<BR>
忽然说道：“要是我也像达西先生那么有钱，<BR>
我真不知道会骄傲到什么地步呢。我要养一群<BR>
猎狗，还要每天喝一瓶酒。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said
Mrs. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take
away your bottle directly."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太说：“那你就喝得太过分啦，要量<BR>
给我看见了，我就马上夺掉你的酒瓶。”<BR></TD>

that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
