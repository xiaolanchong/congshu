<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.
The visit was returned in due form.  Miss Bennet's pleasing
manners grew on the good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley;
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the
younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better
acquainted with <I>them</I> was expressed towards the two eldest.
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure;
but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not
like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a
value, as arising in all probability from the influence of
their brother's admiration.  It was generally evident whenever
they met, that he <I>did</I> admire her; and to <I>her</I> it was equally
evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had
begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to
be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since
Jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of
temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard
her from the suspicions of the impertinent.  She mentioned this
to her friend Miss Lucas.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">浪博恩小姐们不久就去拜访尼日斐花园的小姐<BR>
们了。人家了照例来回拜了她们。班纳特那种<BR>
讨人喜爱的举止，使赫斯脱太太和彬格莱小姐<BR>
对她愈来愈有好感。尽管班家老太太叫人不可<BR>
容忍，几个小妹妹也不值得攀谈，可是两位彬<BR>
格莱小姐不是愿意跟年纪大的两位班小姐作进<BR>
一步深交，吉英极其喜悦地领受了这份盛意；<BR>
可是伊丽莎白看出她们对待任何人仍然很高傲<BR>
，甚至对待吉英也几乎没有两样，因此颇不喜<BR>
欢她们；不过，她们所以待吉英好，看来多半<BR>
还是由于她们兄弟爱慕她的缘故。只要你看见<BR>
他们俩在一起，你就看得出他兄弟确是爱慕她<BR>
的。伊丽莎白又很清楚地看出吉英一开头就看<BR>
中了彬格莱先生，不由自主地向他屈服了，而<BR>
且也可以说是对他喜爱极了。可是她高兴地想<BR>
道，吉英虽说感情丰富，好在性格很镇定，外<BR>
表上仍然保持着正常的和颜悦色，那就不会引<BR>
起那些卤莽人的怀疑，因此他俩的心意也就不<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to
impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a
disadvantage to be so very guarded.  If a woman conceals her
affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may
lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but
poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.  We can
all <I>begin</I> freely -- a slight preference is natural enough;
but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really
in love without encouragement.  In nine cases out of ten, a
woman had better show <I>more</I> affection than she feels.  Bingley
likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than
like her, if she does not help him on."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">夏绿蒂当时说道：“这种事想瞒过大家，也许<BR>
是怪有意思的，不过，这样提心吊胆，有时候<BR>
反而不妙。要是一个女人在她自己心爱的人面<BR>
前，也用这种技巧遮遮掩掩，不让他知道她对<BR>
他有意思，那她就可能没有机会博得他的欢心<BR>
；那么，就是肥天下人都蒙在鼓里，也无补于<BR>
事。男女恋爱大都免不了要借重于双方的感恩<BR>
图报之心和虚荣自负之感，听其自然是很难成<BR>
其好事的。恋爱的开头都是随随便便──某人<BR>
对某人发生点儿好感，本是极其自然的一回事<BR>
；只可惜没有对方和鼓励而自己就肯没头没脑<BR>
去钟情的人，简直太少了。女人家十有八九都<BR>
是心里有一分爱表面上就露出两分。毫无问题<BR>
，彬格莱喜欢你姐姐；可是你姐姐如果不帮他<BR>
一把劲，他也许喜欢喜欢她就算了。”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.
If <I>I</I> can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton
indeed not to discover it too."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不过她已经尽心竭力在帮他的忙了。要量我<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.  But though Bingley
and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours
together; and as they always see each other in large mixed
parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed
in conversing together.  Jane should therefore make the most of
every half hour in which she can command his attention.  When
she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love
as much as she chooses."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“要是男方和女方见面的机会很多，或许他总<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is
in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were
determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I
should adopt it.  But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not
acting by design.  As yet, she cannot even be certain of the
degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.  She has
known him only a fortnight.  She danced four dances with him at
Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has
since dined in company with him four times.  This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白回答道“倘使只求嫁一个有钱的男人<BR>
，你这个办法妙极了，我如果决心找个阔丈夫<BR>
，或者干脆只要随便找个丈夫就算数，我或许<BR>
会照你的办法去做。可惜吉英不是这样想法的<BR>
；她为人处世，就是不愿意使心眼儿。而且，<BR>
她自己也还拿不准她究竟对她钟情到什么地步<BR>
，钟情得是否得体。她认识他才不过两个星期<BR>
。她在麦里屯跟他跳了四次舞；有天上午她在<BR>
他家里跟他见过一次面，此后又跟他吃过四次<BR>
晚饭，可是总有别人在一起。就这么点儿来往<BR>
，叫她怎么能了解他的性格呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Not as you represent it.  Had she merely <I>dined</I> with him, she
might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but
you must remember that four evenings have been also spent
together -- and four evenings may do a great deal."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“事情并不是你所说的那样。要是她只跟他吃<BR>
吃晚饭，那她或许只看得出他的饭量好不好；<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that
they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect
to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much
has been unfolded."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“是的；这四个晚上叫他们彼此摸透了一样性<BR>
格，那就是他们俩都喜欢玩二十一点，不喜欢<BR>
玩‘康梅司’；讲到别的重要的特点，我看他<BR>
们彼此之间还了解很少。”1<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart;
and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she
had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying
his character for a twelvemonth.  Happiness in marriage is
entirely a matter of chance.  If the dispositions of the
parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so
similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least.  They always contrive to grow sufficiently unlike
afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to
know as little as possible of the defects of the person with
whom you are to pass your life."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“唔，”夏绿蒂说，“我一心一意祝吉英成功<BR>
。我以为即使她明天就跟他结婚，她秘能获得<BR>
的幸福，比起她花上一年的时间，研究了他的<BR>
性格、再去跟他结婚所能获得的幸福，并不见<BR>
得会少到哪里去。婚姻生活是否幸福，完全是<BR>
个机会问题。一对爱人婚前脾气措得非常透，<BR>
或者脾气非常相同，这并不能保证他们俩就会<BR>
幸福。他们总是弄到后来距离越来越远，彼此<BR>
烦恼。你既然得和这个人过一辈子，你最尽量<BR>
少了解他的缺点。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.  You know
it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way
yourself."
<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister,
Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming
an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.
Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he
had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they
next met, he looked at her only to criticise.  But no sooner
had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was
rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of
her dark eyes.  To this discovery succeeded some others equally
mortifying.  Though he had detected with a critical eye more
than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced
to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in
spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the
fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.  Of
this she was perfectly unaware; -- to her he was only the man
who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought
her handsome enough to dance with.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白一心只知道谈论彬格莱先生对她姐姐<BR>
的殷勤，却一点儿没想到她自己已经成了彬格<BR>
莱那位朋友的意中人。说到达西先生，他开头<BR>
并不认为她怎么漂亮；他在跳舞会上望着她的<BR>
时候，并没有带着丝毫的爱慕之意，第二次见<BR>
面的时候，他也不过有吹毛求疵的眼光去看待<BR>
她。不过，他尽管在朋友们面前，在自己心里<BR>
，都说她的面貌一无可取，可是眨下眼的工夫<BR>
，他就发觉她那双乌黑的眼睛美丽非凡，使她<BR>
的整个脸蛋儿显得极其聪慧。紧接着这个发现<BR>
之后，他又在她向上发现了几个同样叫人怄气<BR>
的地方。他带着挑剔的眼光，发觉她的身段这<BR>
儿也不匀称，那儿也不匀称，可是他到底不得<BR>
不承认她体态轻盈，惹人喜爱；虽然他嘴上一<BR>
口咬定她缺少上流社会的翩翩风采，可是她落<BR>
落大方爱打趣的作风，又把他迷住了。伊丽莎<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards
conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with
others.  His doing so drew her notice.  It was at Sir William
Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.  "What does
Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?"

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西开始希望跟她深交。他为了想要慢慢地跟<BR>

"Very well; if it must be so, it must."  And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body
here is of course familiar with -- ``Keep your breath to cool

though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long
