Upper-Intermediate - The Stepmother Role

(D1685)

A:

妙妙啊，妈妈看你最近情绪不太稳定，是不是有什么心事？

Miàomiao a, māma kàn nǐ zuìjìn qíngxù bùtài wěndìng, shì bu shì yǒu shénme xīnshì?

Hey, Miaomiao. I feel like your moods have been all over the place these days. Is there something on your mind?

B:

妈我没事，您别瞎操心了。

mā wǒ méishì, nín bié xiā cāoxīn le.

I'm OK, mom. There's nothing to worry about.

A:

妈就你一个宝贝女儿，能不操心吗?你是不是谈朋友了？

mā jiù nǐ yī ge bǎobèi nǚ'ér, néng bù cāoxīn ma? nǐ shì bu shì tán péngyou le?

You're my only daughter, honey. How can I not worry about you? Is it that you found a boyfriend?

B:

嗯。正处着呢。

ng4. zhèng chǔ zhe ne.

Yeah. We've been seeing each other.

A:

他什么情况？能不能跟妈妈说说？

tā shénme qíngkuàng? néng bu néng gēn māma shuō shuo?

What's his story? Can you talk to me about it?

B:

是我以前公司的上司，一直挺欣赏我的。我们也很谈得来。

shì wǒ yǐqián gōngsī de shàngsi, yīzhí tǐng xīnshǎng wǒ de. wǒmen yě hěn tándelái.

He worked above me at my last job. He was always quite nice to me. We got along really well too.

A:

哦，是不是姓杨，叫杨什么来着？

ò, shì bu shì xìng Yáng, jiào Yáng shénme láizhe?

Oh, is that Yang guy? Named Yang something or other?

B:

妈你记性真好。

mā nǐ jìxing zhēn hǎo.

Mom, you have a really good memory.

A:

他不是结婚了吗？你可不能去做小三破坏人家家庭。

tā bùshì jiéhūn le ma? nǐ kě bùnéng qù zuò xiǎosān pòhuài rénjiā jiātíng.

Isn't he married? You really can't go having an affair and breaking apart other people's families.

B:

妈，怎么会？他老婆常年在国外，现在离婚了。

mā, zěnme huì? tā lǎopó chángnián zài guówài, xiànzài líhūn le.

Mom, how could I? His wife was abroad most of the year. They are divorced now.

A:

离婚了？有孩子没？孩子归谁？

líhūn le? yǒu háizi méi? háizi guī shéi?

Divorced? Do they have any children? Who will be in charge of the kids?

B:

有一个女儿，挺乖巧的。

yǒu yī ge nǚér, tǐng guāiqiǎo de.

They have a daughter. She's really cute.

A:

你个傻孩子，你以为后妈是那么好当的？

nǐ ge shǎ háizi, nǐ yǐwéi hòumā shì nàme hǎo dāng de?

Don't be stupid. You think being a stepmother would be so easy?

B:

我也不想，也许这就是命吧！

wǒ yě bù xiǎng, yěxǔ zhè jiùshì mìng ba!

I don't want to be, but maybe that's my fate!

A:

真作孽啊！

zhēn zuòniè a!

How despicable!

B:

其实开始我也不愿意，后来接触多了，觉得别人都没他成熟稳重。

qíshí kāishǐ wǒ yě bù yuànyì, hòulái jiēchù duō le, juéde biérén dōu méi tā chéngshú wěnzhòng.

I wasn't open to the idea at first either, actually. But as I got to know him better, I don't think anyone else is as mature and stable as he is.

A:

先不说你们俩。后妈不好当，你对她严厉了，她会说你虐待她，对她宽松了，又会说你不管她。反正净说你坏话。当后妈就是吃力不讨好。

xiān bù shuō nǐmen liǎ. hòumā bù hǎo dāng, nǐ duì tā yánlì le, tā huì shuō nǐ nǜedài tā, duì tā kuānsōng le, yòu huì shuō nǐ bù guǎn tā. fǎnzhèng jìng shuō nǐ huàihuà. dāng hòumā jiùshì chīlì bù tǎohǎo.

Don't worry about the two of you. There's nothing good about being a stepmother. If you're strict with her, she'll say you're abusing her. If you're easy on her, she'll say you don't care about her. Whatever you do, she'll speak poorly of you. Being a stepmother is a tireless job that gets you no respect.

B:

那小姑娘挺喜欢我的。

nà xiǎogūniang tǐng xǐhuan wǒ de.

The little girl really likes me.

A:

那是还没天天在一起。现在的小孩儿多难伺候啊，你别一时糊涂昏了头，到时候有你受的。反正我不同意你去当后妈。

nà shì hái méi tiāntiān zài yīqǐ. xiànzài de xiǎoháir duō nán cìhou a, nǐ bié yīshí hútu hūn le tóu, dào shíhou yǒu nǐ shòu de. fǎnzhèng wǒ bù tóngyì nǐ qù dāng hòumā.

You're not living together right now. Children are very hard to please these days. Don't be rash and lose your head now, and then end up suffering in the end. Regardless, I don't agree with you going and becoming a stepmother.

B:

我就知道你会不同意！不跟你说了！

wǒ jiù zhīdào nǐ huì bù tóngyì! bù gēn nǐ shuō le!

I knew you wouldn't agree! I'm done talking to you!
