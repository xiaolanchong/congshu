<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of
two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters,
was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation;
and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in
life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.  Her father
had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand
pounds.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特先生的全部家当几乎都在一宗产业上，<BR>
每年可以借此获得两千磅的收入。说起这宗产<BR>
业，真是他女儿们的不幸。他因为没有儿子，<BR>
产业得由一个远亲来继承，至于她们母亲的家<BR>
私，在这样的人家本来也算得上一笔大数目，<BR>
事实上却还不够裣他的损失。班纳特太太的父<BR>
亲曾经在麦里屯当过律师，给了她四千英镑的<BR>
遗产。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a
clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a
brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她有过妹妹，嫁给了她爸爸的书记腓力普，妹<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually
tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty
to their aunt, and to a milliner's shop just over the way.  The
two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were
particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were
more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better
offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however
bare of news the country in general might be, they always
contrived to learn some from their aunt.  At present, indeed,
they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the
recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it
was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head
quarters.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">浪博恩这个村子和麦里屯相隔只有一英里路，<BR>
这么一段距离对于那几位年轻的小姐们是再便<BR>
利不过的了，她们每星期总得上那儿在三四次<BR>
，看看她们的姨母，还可以顺便看看那边一家<BR>
卖女人帽子的商店。两个最小的妹妹咖苔琳和<BR>
丽迪雅特别倾心于这方面，她们比姐姐们心事<BR>
要少得多，每当没有更好的消遣办法时，就必<BR>
定到麦里屯走一遭，消遣消遣美好的晨光，并<BR>
且晚上也就有了谈助。尽管这村子里通常没有<BR>
什么新闻可以打听，她们还老是千方百计地从<BR>
她们姨妈那儿打听到一些。附近地方最近开到<BR>
了一团民兵，她们的消息来源当然从此就丰富<BR>
了，真叫她们高兴非凡。这一团人要在这儿驻<BR>
扎整个冬天，麦里屯就是司令部的所在地。<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence.  Every day added something to their
knowledge of the officers' names and connections.  Their
lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to
know the officers themselves.  Mr. Philips visited them all,
and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown
before.  They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to
their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">从此她们每次拜访腓力普太太都获得了最有趣<BR>
的消息。她们每天都会打听到几个军官的名字<BR>
和他们的社会关系。军官们的住宅不久就让大<BR>
家知道了，再后来小姐们就直接跟他们搞熟了<BR>
，腓力普先生一一拜访了那些军官，这真是替<BR>
她的姨侄女们开辟了一道意想不到的幸福源泉<BR>
。她们现在开口闭口都离不开那些军官。在这<BR>
以前，只要提到彬格莱先生的偌大财产，她们<BR>
的母亲就会眉飞色舞，如今跟军官们的制服对<BR>
比起来，她们就觉得偌大的财产简直一钱不值<BR>

Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the
day, as he was going the next morning to London.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">咖苔琳一听此话，颇感不安，可是并没有回答<BR>

要到伦敦去。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should

着两样的见解。”<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the
sense of their father and mother. -- When they get to our age,
I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we
do.  I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very
well -- and indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart
young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want
one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir
William's in his regimentals."

爱‘红制服’───当然，到现在我心里头还<BR>
喜爱‘红制服’呢；要是有位漂亮的年轻上校<BR>
，每年有五六千磅的收入，随便向我的哪一个<BR>
女儿求婚，我决不会拒绝他的；有天晚上在威<BR>

Clarke's library."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the
footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield,

her daughter read,

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that
the horses were engaged.  Jane was therefore obliged to go on
horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many
cheerful prognostics of a bad day.  Her hopes were answered;
Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.  Her sisters
were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.  The rain
continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane
certainly could not come back.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她终于逼得父亲不得不承认──那儿匹拉车子<BR>

吉英走了不久，就下起大雨来。妹妹们都替她<BR>

her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace,
jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane

early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was
almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth
was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.  She was
received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother's manners there was something better than politeness;
there was good humour and kindness. -- Mr. Darcy said very
little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.  The former was divided
between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given
to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying
her coming so far alone.  The latter was thinking only of his
breakfast.

她，而且非常殷勤多礼。达西先生说话不多，<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably
answered.  Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very
feverish and not well enough to leave her room.  Elizabeth was
glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only
been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience,
from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a
visit, was delighted at her entrance.  She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude
for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.  Elizabeth
silently attended her.

Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much
affection and solicitude they showed for Jane.  The apothecary
came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be
supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they
must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return
to bed, and promised her some draughts.  The advice was
followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her
head ached acutely.  Elizabeth did not quit her room for a
moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen
being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.

carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it,
when Jane testified such concern in parting with her that Miss
Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an
invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.  Elizabeth
most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back
a supply of clothes.
