<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting
on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised
to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by
his daughter to announce her engagement to the family.  With
many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the
prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the
matter, -- to an audience not merely wondering, but
incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia,
always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白正跟母亲和姐妹坐在一起，回想刚才<BR>
所听到的那件事，决不定是否可以把它告诉大<BR>
家，就在这时候，威廉・卢卡斯爵士来了。他<BR>
是受了女儿折拜托，前来班府上宣布她订婚的<BR>
消息。他一面叙述这件事，一面又大大地恭维<BR>
了太太小姐们一阵，说是两家能结上亲，他真<BR>
感到荣幸。班府上的人听了，不仅感到惊异，<BR>
而且不相信真有这回事。班纳特太太再也顾不<BR>
得礼貌，竟一口咬定他弄错了。丽迪雅一向中<BR>
又任性又撒野，不由得叫道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Good Lord!  Sir William, how can you tell such a story? --
Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“天哪！威廉爵士，你怎么会说出这番话来？<BR>
你不知道柯林斯先生要娶丽萃吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have
borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good
breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave
to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened
to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">遇到这种情形，只有象朝廷大臣那样能够逆来<BR>
顺受的人，才不会生气，好在威廉爵士颇有素<BR>
养，竟没有把它当一回事，虽然他要求她们相<BR>
信他说的是实话，可是他却使出了极大的忍耐<BR>
功夫，满有礼貌地听着她们无理的谈吐。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so
unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his
account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte
herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of
her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her
congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined
by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness
that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from
London.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白觉得自己有责任帮助他来打开这种僵<BR>
局，于是挺身而出，证明他说的实话，说是刚<BR>
刚已经听到夏绿蒂本人谈起过了。为了尽力使<BR>
母亲和妹妹们不再大惊小怪，她便诚恳地向威<BR>
廉爵士道喜，吉英马上也替她帮腔，又用种种<BR>
话来说明这门婚姻是何等幸福，柯林斯先生品<BR>
格又非常好，汉斯福和伦敦相隔不远往返方便<BR>
。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great
deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them
than her feelings found a rapid vent.  In the first place, she
persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly,
she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly,
she trusted that they would never be happy together; and
fourthly, that the match might be broken off.  Two inferences,
however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the
other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all;
and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest
of the day.  Nothing could console and nothing appease her. --
Nor did that day wear out her resentment.  A week elapsed
before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month
passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas
without being rude, and many months were gone before she could
at all forgive their daughter.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太在威廉爵士面前，实在气得说不出<BR>
话；可是他一走，她那一肚子牢骚便马上发泄<BR>
出来。第一，她坚决不相信这回事；第二，她<BR>
断定柯林斯先生受了骗；第三，她相信这一对<BR>
夫妇决不会幸福；第四，这门亲事可能会破裂<BR>
。不过她却从整个事件上简单地得出了两个结<BR>
论───一个是：这场笑话全都是伊丽莎白一<BR>
手造成的；另一个是，她自己受尽了大家的欺<BR>
负虐待；在那一整天里，她所谈的大都是这两<BR>
点。随便怎么也安慰不了她，随便怎么也平不<BR>
了她的气。直到晚上，怨愤依然没有消散。她<BR>
见到伊丽莎白就骂，一直骂了一个星期之久。<BR>
她同威廉爵士或卢卡斯太太说起话来，总是粗<BR>
声粗气，一直过了一个月才好起来；至于夏绿<BR>
蒂，她竟过了好几个月才宽恕了她。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,
and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most
agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that
Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably
sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his
daughter!
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">对班纳特先生说来，这件事反而使他心情上益<BR>
发洒脱，据他说，这次所经过的一切，真使他<BR>
精神上舒服到极点。他说，他本以为夏绿蒂・<BR>
卢卡斯相当懂事，哪知道她简直跟他太太一样<BR>
蠢，比起他的女儿来就更要蠢了，他实在觉得<BR>
高兴！<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she
said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for
their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider
it as improbable.  Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss
Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected
them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at
Meryton.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英也承认这门婚姻有些奇怪，可是她嘴上并<BR>
没说什么，反而诚恳地祝他们俩幸福。虽然伊<BR>
丽莎白再三剖白给她听，她却始终以为这门婚<BR>
姻未必一定不会幸福。吉蒂和丽迪雅根本不羡<BR>
慕民卢卡斯小姐，因为柯林斯先生不过是个传<BR>
教士而已；这件事根本影响不了她们，除非把<BR>
它当作一件新闻，带到麦里屯去传播一下。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to
retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well
married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual
to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and
ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness
away.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">再说到卢卡斯太太，她既然也有一个女儿获得<BR>
了美满的姻缘，自然衷心快慰，因而也不会不<BR>
想到趁此去向班纳特太太反唇相讥一下。于是<BR>
她拜望浪博恩的次数比往常更加频繁，说是她<BR>
如今多么高兴，不过班纳特太太满脸恶相，满<BR>
口的毒话，也足够叫她扫兴的了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which
kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth
felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist
between them again.  Her disappointment in Charlotte made
her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude
and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken,
and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of
his return.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白和夏绿蒂之间从此竟有了一层隔膜，<BR>
彼此不便提到这桩事。伊丽莎白断定她们俩再<BR>
也不会象从前那样推心置腹。她既然在夏绿蒂<BR>
身上失望，便越发亲切地关注到自己姐姐身上<BR>
来。她深信姐姐为人正直，作风优雅，她这种<BR>
看法决不会动摇。她关心姐姐的幸福一天比一<BR>
天来得迫切，因为彬格莱先生已经走了一个星<BR>
期，却没有听到一点儿她要回来的消息。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was
counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.
The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on
Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the
solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the
family might have prompted.  After discharging his conscience
on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous
expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that
it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had
been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again
at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday
fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved
his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as
possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument
with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英很早就给珈罗琳写了回信，现在正在数着<BR>
日子，看看还得过多少天才可以又接到她的信<BR>
。柯林斯先生事先答应写来的那封谢函星期二<BR>
就收到了，信是写给她们父亲的，信上说了多<BR>
少感激的话，看他那种过甚其辞的语气，就好<BR>
象在他们府上叨光了一年似的。他在这方面表<BR>
示了歉意以后，便用了多少欢天喜地的措辞，<BR>
告诉他们说，他已经有幸获得他们的芳邻卢卡<BR>
斯小姐的欢心了，他接着又说，为了要去看看<BR>
他的心上人，他可以趁便来看看他们，免得辜<BR>
负他们善意的期望，希望能在两个礼拜以后的<BR>
星期一到达浪博恩；他又说，珈苔琳夫人衷心<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter
of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet.  On the contrary, she was as much
disposed to complain of it as her husband. -- It was very
strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas
Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly
troublesome. -- She hated having visitors in the house while
her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people
the most disagreeable.  Such were the gentle murmurs of
Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of
Mr. Bingley's continued absence.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">对班纳特太太说来，柯林斯先生的重返浪博恩<BR>
，如今并不是什么叫人快意的事了。她反而跟<BR>
她丈夫一样地大为抱怨。说也奇怪，柯林斯不<BR>
去卢家庄，却要来到浪搏恩，这真是既不方便<BR>
，以太麻烦。她现在正当健康失调，因此非常<BR>
讨厌客人上门，何况这些痴情种子都是再讨厌<BR>
的人。班纳特太太成天嘀咕着这些事，除非想<BR>
到彬格莱一直不回来而使她她感到更在的痛苦<BR>
时，她方才住口。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings
of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of
his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report
which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed
to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英跟伊丽莎白都为这个问题大感不安。一天<BR>
又一天，听不到一点关于他的消息，只听得麦<BR>
里屯纷纷传言，说他今冬再也不会上尼日斐花<BR>
园来了，班纳特太太听得非常生气，总是加以<BR>
驳斥，说那是诬蔑性的谣言。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was
indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in
keeping him away.  Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so
destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the
stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently
recurring.  The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and
of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she
feared, for the strength of his attachment.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">连伊丽莎白也开始恐惧起来了，她并不是怕彬<BR>
格莱薄情，而是怕他的姐妹们真的绊住了他。<BR>
尽管她不愿意有这种想法，因为这种想法对于<BR>
吉英的幸福既有不利，对于吉英心上人的忠贞<BR>
，也未免是一种侮辱，可是她还是往往禁不住<BR>
要这样想。他那两位无情无义的姐妹，和那位<BR>
足以制服他的朋友同心协力，再加上达西小姐<BR>
的窈窕妩媚，以及伦敦的声色娱乐，纵使他果<BR>
真对她念念不忘，恐怕也挣脱不了那个圈套。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As for Jane, <I>her</I> anxiety under this suspence was, of course,
more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was
desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,
therefore, the subject was never alluded to.  But as no such
delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which
she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his
arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not
come back, she should think herself very ill used.  It needed
all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">至于吉英，她在这种动荡不安的情况下，自然<BR>
比伊丽莎白更加感到焦虑，可是她总不愿意把<BR>
自己的心事暴露出来，所以她和伊丽莎白一直<BR>
没有提到这件事。偏偏她母亲不能体贴她的苦<BR>
衷，过不了一个钟头就要提到彬格莱，说是等<BR>
待他回来实在等待心焦，甚至硬要吉英承认─<BR>
─要是彬格莱果真不回来，那她一定会觉得自<BR>
己受了薄情的亏待。幸亏吉英临事从容不迫，<BR>
柔和镇定，好容易才忍受了她这些谗言诽语。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight,
but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it
had been on his first introduction.  He was too happy, however,
to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the
business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his
company.  The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas
Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to
make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">柯林斯先生在两个礼拜以后的星期一准时到达<BR>
，可是浪搏恩却不象他初来时那样热烈地欢迎<BR>
他了。他实在高兴不过也不不着别人献殷勤。<BR>
这真是主人家走运，多亏他恋爱成了功，这才<BR>
使别人能够清闲下来，不必再去跟他周旋。他<BR>
每天把大部分时间消磨在卢家庄，一直挨到卢<BR>
府上快要睡觉的时候，才回到浪搏恩来，向大<BR>
家道歉一声，请大家原谅他终日未归。<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.  The very
mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an
agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of
hearing it talked of.  The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to
her.  As her successor in that house, she regarded her with
jealous abhorrence.  Whenever Charlotte came to see them she
concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced
that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving
to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as
Mr. Bennet were dead.  She complained bitterly of all this to
her husband.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太着实可怜。只要一提到那门亲事，<BR>
她就会不高兴，而且随便她走到那儿，她总会<BR>

替她做这幢屋子里的主妇，她就益发嫉妒和厌<BR>
恶。每逢夏绿蒂来看她们，她总以为人家是来<BR>
考察情况，看看还要过多少时候就可以搬进来<BR>
住；每逢夏绿蒂跟柯林斯先生低声说话的时候<BR>
，她就以为他们是在谈论浪搏恩的家产，是在<BR>
