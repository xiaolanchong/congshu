<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she
could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal
felicity or domestic comfort.  Her father, captivated by youth
and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and
beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak
understanding and illiberal mind had, very early in their
marriage, put an end to all real affection for her.  Respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views
of domestic happiness were overthrown.  But Mr. Bennet was not
of a disposition to seek comfort, for the disappointment which
his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures
which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or
their vice.  He was fond of the country and of books; and from
these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.  To his wife
he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance
and folly had contributed to his amusement.  This is not the
sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to
his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting,
the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are
given.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">倘若叫伊丽莎白根据她自己家庭的情形，来说<BR>
一说什么叫做婚姻的幸福，什么叫做家庭的乐<BR>
趣，那她一定说不出好话来。她父亲当年就因<BR>

带来很大的情趣，因此娶了这样一个适中适中<BR>
智力贫乏而又小心眼儿的女人，迟到结婚不久<BR>
，他对太太的深挚的情意便完结了。夫妇之间<BR>
的互敬互爱和推心置腹。都永远消失得无影无<BR>

换了别的人，凡是因为自己的冒失而招来了不<BR>

乡村景色，喜爱书自娱，这就是他最大的乐趣<BR>

供他开心作乐之外，他对她就再没有别的恩情<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of
her father's behaviour as a husband.  She had always seen it
with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his
affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget
what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts
that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which,
in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was
so highly reprehensible.  But she had never felt so strongly as
now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the
evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents;
talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the
respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging
the mind of his wife.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">不过伊丽莎白并不是看不出父亲的缺德。她老<BR>

亲大不该叫孩子们看不起妈妈，以致使他们老<BR>
夫妇一天比一天不能够互敬互爱地相处，她也<BR>
尽量不去想它。但是，说到不美满的婚姻给儿<BR>
女们带来的不利，她从前决没有象现在体验得<BR>
这样深刻再说，父亲的才能使用得不得当因而<BR>
造成种种害处，这一点她她从来没有象现在这<BR>
样看得透彻。要是父亲的才能运用得适当，即<BR>

儿们的体面。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she
found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the
regiment.  Their parties abroad were less varied than before;
and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant
repinings at the dullness of every thing around them threw a
real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might
in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the
disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from
whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely
to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of
such double danger as a watering place and a camp.  Upon the
whole, therefore, she found what has been sometimes found
before, that an event to which she had looked forward with
impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself.  It was consequently
necessary to name some other period for the commencement of
actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes
and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of
anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for
another disappointment.  Her tour to the Lakes was now the
object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of
her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have
included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been
perfect.

with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence,
I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure
realized.  A scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded
off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very
minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always
long expected, and always very short.  Those to her mother
contained little else, than that they were just returned from
the library, where such and such officers had attended them,
and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her
quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave
off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they
were going to the camp; -- and from her correspondence with her
sister, there was still less to be learnt -- for her letters to
Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under
the words to be made public.

health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to re-appear at
Longbourn.  Everything wore a happier aspect.  The families who
had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer
finery and summer engagements arose.  Mrs. Bennet was restored
to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton
without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make
Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas, she might be so
tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a
day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the
War-Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.

fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when
a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its
commencement and curtailed its extent.  Mr. Gardiner would be
prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later
in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as
that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so
much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the
leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to
give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and,
according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward
than Derbyshire.  In that county, there was enough to be seen
to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner
it had a peculiarly strong attraction.  The town where she had
formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now
to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her
curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock,
Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.

it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.

Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which
their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth,
Birmingham, &amp;c. are sufficiently known.  A small part of
Derbyshire is all the present concern.  To the little town of
Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and
where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still
remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was
situated.  It was not in their direct road, nor more than a
mile or two out of it.  In talking over their route the evening
before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place
again.  Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth
was applied to for her approbation.

Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for
seeing it.  She must own that she was tired of great houses;
after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine
carpets or satin curtains.
Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.  "If it were merely a fine
house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it
myself; but the grounds are delightful.  They have some of the
finest woods in the country."

The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,

her aunt than to run such a risk.  But against this there were
objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last
resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the
family were unfavourably answered.

chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place,
what was the name of its proprietor, and, with no little

welcome negative followed the last question -- and her alarms
being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was
revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could
readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that
she had not really any dislike to the scheme.
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
