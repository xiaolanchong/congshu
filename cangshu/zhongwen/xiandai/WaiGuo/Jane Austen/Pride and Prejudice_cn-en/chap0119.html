<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.  Mr. Collins
made his declaration in form.  Having resolved to do it without
loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the
following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to
make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set
about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances
which he supposed a regular part of the business.  On finding
Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together
soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">第二天，浪博恩发生了一件新的事情。柯林斯<BR>
先生正式提出求婚了。他的假期到下星期六就<BR>
要满期，于是决定不再耽搁时间，况且当时他<BR>
丝毫也不觉得有什么不好意思，便有条不紊地<BR>
着手进行起来，凡是他认为必不可少的正常步<BR>
骤，他都照办了。刚一吃过早饭，看到班纳特<BR>
太太、伊丽莎白和一个小妹妹在一起，他便对<BR>
那位做母亲的这样说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter
Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience
with her in the course of this morning?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“太太今天早上我想要请令嫒伊丽莎白赏光，<BR>
跟我作一次私人谈话，你赞成吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of
surprise, Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">在伊丽莎白表示惊讶时班纳特太太立即说:<BR></TD><!-- this passage translated by the lovely Zhi Chun -->
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh dear! -- Yes -- certainly. -- I am sure Lizzy will be very
happy -- I am sure she can have no objection. -- Come, Kitty,
I want you up stairs."  And gathering her work together, she
was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“噢，好极了，当然可以。我相信丽萃也很乐<BR>
意的，我相信她还会反对。──来，吉蒂；跟<BR>
我上楼去。”她把针线收拾了一下，便匆匆忙<BR>
忙走开了，这时伊丽莎白叫起来了：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Dear Ma'am, do not go. -- I beg you will not go. -- Mr.
Collins must excuse me. -- He can have nothing to say to me
that any body need not hear.  I am going away myself."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“亲爱的妈，别走。我求求你别走。柯林斯先<BR>
生一定会原谅我。他要跟我说和话，别人都可<BR>
以听的。我也要走了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. -- I desire you will stay where
you are." -- And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed
and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "Lizzy,
I <I>insist</I> upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不，不；你别胡扯，丽萃。我要你待在这儿<BR>
不动。”只见伊丽莎白又恼又窘，好象真要逃<BR>
走的样子，于是她又说道：“我非要你待在这<BR>
儿听柯林斯先生说话不可。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction -- and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest
to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down
again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the
feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.
Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone
Mr. Collins began.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白不便违抗母命。她考虑了一会儿，觉<BR>
得能够赶快悄悄地把事情解决了也好，于是她<BR>
重新坐了下来，时时刻刻当心着，不让啼笑皆<BR>
非的心情流露出来。班纳特太太和吉蒂走开了<BR>
，她们一走，柯林斯先生便开口说话：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far
from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other
perfections.  You would have been less amiable in my eyes had
there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to
assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for
this address.  You can hardly doubt the purport of my
discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the
companion of my future life.  But before I am run away with by
my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for
me to state my reasons for marrying -- and moreover for coming
into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I
certainly did."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“说真的，伊丽莎白小姐，你害羞怕臊，非但<BR>
对你没有丝毫损害，而且更增加了你的天生丽<BR>
质。要是你不这样稍许推委一下，我反而不会<BR>
觉得你这么可爱了。可是请你允许我告诉你一<BR>
声，我这次跟你求婚，是获得了令堂大人的允<BR>
许的。尽管你天性羞怯，假痴假呆，可是我对<BR>
你的百般殷勤，已经表现得非常明显，你一定<BR>
会明白我说话的用意。我差不多一进这屋子，<BR>
就挑中你做我的终身伴侣。不过关于这个问题<BR>
，也许最好趁我现在还控制得住我自己感情的<BR>
时候，先谈谈我要结婚的理由，更要谈一谈我<BR>
来到哈福德郡择偶的打算，因为我的确是存着<BR>
那种打算的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being
run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing
that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any
attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">想到柯林斯这么一本正经的样子，居然会控制<BR>
不住他自己的感情，伊丽莎白不禁觉得非常好<BR>
笑，因此他虽然说话停了片刻，她可没有来得<BR>
及阻止他往下说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right
thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself)
to set the example of matrimony in his parish.  Secondly, that
I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and
thirdly -- which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier,
that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very
noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice
has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on
this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before
I left Hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille, while
Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that
she said, ``Mr. Collins, you must marry.  A clergyman like you
must marry. -- Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for <I>my</I>
sake; and for your <I>own</I>, let her be an active, useful sort of
person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go
a good way.  This is my advice.  Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.''  Allow
me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not
reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as
among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.  You
will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your
wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially
when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will
inevitably excite.  Thus much for my general intention in
favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were
directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women.  But the fact
is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death
of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years
longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose
a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be
as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place --
which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several
years.  This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter
myself it will not sink me in your esteem.  And now nothing
remains-for me but to assure you in the most animated language
of the violence of my affection.  To fortune I am perfectly
indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your
father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied
with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents, which
will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that
you may ever be entitled to.  On that head, therefore, I shall
be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no
ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are
married."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我所以要结婚，有这样几点理由：第一，我<BR>
认为凡是象我这样生活宽裕的牧师，理当给全<BR>
教区树立一个婚姻的好榜样；其次，我深信结<BR>
婚会大大地促进我的幸福；第三（这一点或许<BR>
我应该早提出来），我三生有幸，能够等候上<BR>
这样高贵的一个女施主，她特别劝告我结婚，<BR>
特别赞成我结婚。蒙她两次替我在这件事情上<BR>
提出了意见（而且并不是我请教她的！），就<BR>
在我离开汉斯福的前一个星期六晚上，我们正<BR>
在玩牌，姜金生太太正在为德・包尔小姐安放<BR>
脚橙，夫人对我说：‘柯林斯先生，你必须结<BR>
婚。象你这样的一个牧师，必须结婚。好好儿<BR>
去挑选吧，挑选一个好人家的女儿，为了我，<BR>
也为了你自己；人要长得活泼，要能做事，不<BR>
求出身高贵，但要会算计，把一笔小小的收入<BR>
安排得妥妥贴贴。这就是我的意见。赶快找个<BR>
这样的女人来吧，把她带到汉斯福来，我自会<BR>
照料她的。’好表妹，让我说给你听吧，咖苔<BR>
琳・德・包尔夫人对我的体贴照顾，也可以算<BR>
是我一个优越的条件。她的为人我真无法形容<BR>
，你有一天会看到的。我想，你这样的聪明活<BR>
泼一定会叫她喜欢，只要你在她那样身份高贵<BR>
的人面前显得稳重端庄些，她就会特别喜欢你<BR>
。大体上我要结婚就是为的这些打算；现在还<BR>
得说一说，我们自己村里多的是年轻可爱的姑<BR>
娘，我为什么看中了浪博恩，而没有看中我自<BR>
己村庄的呢？事情是这样的：往后令尊过世（<BR>
但愿他长命百岁），得由我继承财产，因此我<BR>
打算娶他要个女儿作家室，使得将来这件不愉<BR>
快的事发生的时候，你们的损失可以尽量轻一<BR>
些，否则我实在过意不去。当然，正如我刚才<BR>
说过的，这事情也许要在多少年以后才会发生<BR>
。我的动机就是这样，好表妹，恕我不揣冒昧<BR>
地说一句，你不至于因此就看不起我吧。现在<BR>
我的话已经说完，除非是再用最激动的语言把<BR>
我最热烈的感情向你倾诉。说到妆奁财产，我<BR>
完全无所谓，我决不会在这方面向你父亲提出<BR>
什么要求，我非常了解，他的能力也办不到，<BR>
你名下应得的财产，一共不过是一笔年息四厘<BR>
的一千镑存款，还得等你妈死后才归你所得。<BR>
因此关于那个问题，我也一声不响，而且请你<BR>
放心，我们结婚以后，我决不会说一句小气话<BR>
。”<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried.  "You forget that I have
made no answer.  Let me do it without farther loss of time.
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me, I am
very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is
impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你太心急了吧，先生，”她叫了起来。“你<BR>
忘了我根本没有回答你呢。别再浪费时间，就<BR>

我感到荣幸，可惜我除了谢绝之外，别无办法<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal
wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject
the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept,
when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the
refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.  I am
therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said,
and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">柯林斯先生郑重其事地挥手回答道：“年轻的<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.  I do assure you that
I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there
are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance
of being asked a second time.  I am perfectly serious in my
refusal. -- You could not make <I>me</I> happy, and I am convinced
that I am the last woman in the world who would make <I>you</I> so,
-- Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am
persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for
the situation."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白嚷道：“不瞒你说，先生，我既然话<BR>
已经说出了口，你还要存着指望，那真太奇怪<BR>
了。老实跟你说，如果世上真有那么胆大的年<BR>
轻小姐，拿自己的幸福去冒险，让人家提出第<BR>
二次请求，那我也不是这种人。我的谢绝完全<BR>
是严肃的。你不能使我幸福，而且我，相信我<BR>
也绝对不能使你幸福。唔，要是你的朋友咖苔<BR>
琳夫人认识我的话，我相信她一定会发觉，我<BR>
无论在哪一方面，都不配做你的太太。”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said
Mr. Collins very gravely -- "but I cannot imagine that her
ladyship would at all disapprove of you.  And you may be
certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall
speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other
amiable qualifications."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">柯林斯先生严肃地说：“就算咖苔琳夫人会有<BR>
这样的想法，我想她老人家也决不会不赞成你<BR>

要在她面前把你的淑静、节俭、以及其他种种<BR>
可爱的优点，大大夸奖一番。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.
You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the
compliment of believing what I say.  I wish you very happy and
very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to
prevent your being otherwise.  In making me the offer, you must
have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my
family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it
falls, without any self-reproach.  This matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled."  And rising as she
thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr.
Collins thus addressed her,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“说实话，柯林斯先生，任你怎么夸奖我，都<BR>
是浪费唇舌。这自己的事自己会有主张，只要<BR>
你相信我所说的话，就是赏我的脸了。我祝你<BR>
幸福豪富。我所以放纵你的未婚，也就是为了<BR>
免得你发生什么意外。而你呢，既然向我提出<BR>
了未婚，那么，你对于我家里的事情，也就不<BR>
必感到有什么不好意思了，将来浪博恩庄园一<BR>
旦轮到你做评价，你就可以取之无愧了。这件<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this
subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than
you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of
cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established
custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application,
and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit
as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female
character."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“要是下趟我有幸再跟你谈到这个问题，我希<BR>
望你能够给我一个比这次满意点的回答。我不<BR>
怪你这次冷酷无情，因为我知道，你们姑娘们<BR>
对于男人第一次的未婚，照例总是描绘，也许<BR>
你刚刚听说的一番话，正符合女人家微妙的性<BR>
格，反而足以鼓励我继续追求下去。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth,
"you puzzle me exceedingly.  If what I have hitherto said can
appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to
express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its
being one."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白一听此话，不免有些气恼，便大声叫<BR>
道：“柯林斯先生，你真弄得我太莫名其妙了<BR>
。我的话已经说到这个地步，要是你还觉得这<BR>

，才能使你死心塌地。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that
your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.  My
reasons for believing it are briefly these: -- It does not
appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that
the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly
desirable.  My situation in life, my connections with the
family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, it into
farther consideration that in spite of your manifold
attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of
marriage may ever be made you.  Your portion is unhappily so
small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your
loveliness and amiable qualifications.  As I must therefore
conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my
love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant
females."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“亲爱的表妹，请允许我说句自不量力的话：<BR>
我相信你拒绝我的未婚，不过是照例说说罢了<BR>
。我所以会这样想，简单说来，有这样几点理<BR>
由：我觉得我向你未婚，并不见得就不值得你<BR>
接受，我的家产你决不会不放在眼里。我的社<BR>
会地位，我同德・包尔府上的关系，以及跟你<BR>
府上的亲戚关系，都是我非常优越的条件。我<BR>
得提请你考虑一下：尽管你有许多吸引人的地<BR>
方，不幸你的财产太少，这就把你的可爱、把<BR>
你许多优美的条件都抵消了，不会有另外一个<BR>
人再向你求婚了，因此我就不得不认为：你这<BR>
一次并不是一本正经地拒绝我，而是彷效一般<BR>
高贵的女性的通例，欲擒故纵，想要更加博得<BR>
我的喜爱。”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to
that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a
respectable man.  I would rather be paid the compliment of
being believed sincere.  I thank you again and again for the
honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them
is absolutely impossible.  My feelings in every respect forbid
it.  Can I speak plainer?  Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature
speaking the truth from her heart."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“先生，我向你保证，这决没有冒充风雅，故<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would
make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew;
determined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated
refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father,
whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be
decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken
for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他再三要存心自欺欺人，伊丽莎白可懒得再去<BR>
理他，马上不声不响地走开了。她打定了主意<BR>

助于她父亲，叫他斩钉截铁地回绝他。柯林斯<BR>
总不见得再把她父亲的拒绝，看作一个高贵女<BR>
