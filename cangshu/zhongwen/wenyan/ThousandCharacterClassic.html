		The ancestors of the Chinese people were systematically cultivating rice and millet over 4,500 years ago, with a grasp of the seasonal timing of planting and reaping. One site, Tao3he2 Mu3du4 in Zhejiang Province has produced evidence of rice cultivation 7,500 years ago, the oldest such record on earth. Chinese farmers very early on used the lunar calendar, known as the agrarian calendar, nong2 li4, to time their activities, using its 24 periods.

The bamboo pitch pipe played 12 notes, six of them high, called lv4 and considered Yang force, and six low, known as lv3 and considered to reflect Yin energy. These corresponded to the twelve months of the year. In addition, the wind and soundwaves from the flute could be used for divination according to Yang and Yin, by scattering ashes.

These are four of China's earliest rulers and officials; they vary according to the many legends. They were perhaps chieftains of small tribal alliances of hamlets. The "Dragon Master" long2 shi1, or, "Dragon-sent Master" long2 ming4 shi1 was none other than Fu2 Xi1, also called Tai4 Hao4, depicted with a snake-like body and human face, who legendarily devised the Ba Gua (trigrams of heaven and earth) and taught his followers how to make nets and to fish, hunt, and raise cattle. Huo3 Di4, the "Fire Emperor" was called Sui4 Ren2, and true to his title he taught the people, legend has it, how to make fire by drilling into wood and how to boil rice. Then there is the later "Glorious (literally, flame) Emperor", or Yan2 Di4, better known as the illustrious Shen2 Nong2, often depicted as a man with the head of an ox. During this reign humanity learned how to make plows and cultivate crops, and he (or the period) is credited in legend with discovering medicinal plants and making the first medicines. Chi1 You2 was chief of a dark-skinned tribe of the north, and gave mankind the first weapons of war. Both he and Shen Nong were defeated by the Yellow Emperor, or Huang2 Di4, named Hsuan1 Yuan2, first to be shown as completely human in form. Chi1 You2 was killed on the plain of Zhuo1 Lu4 in today's central Hebei Province. The Yellow Emperor used the magnetic compass to navigate through Chi You's man-made fog and defeat him. Shao3 Hao4, the "Bird Official" or "Bird-sent Official", niao3 ming4 guan1, was son of Hsuan1 Yuan2, the Yellow Emperor, born of his wife Lei2 Zu3. He was so named for his revision of Tai4 Hao4's (the above Fu Xi's) metaphysical system, the Trigrams, or Tai4 Hao4 Fa3, and his name was Zhi4; titles include Jin1 De2 Wang2, Jin1 Tian1 shi4, and Qiong2 Sang1 shi4 among others. Ren2 Huang2 was the last of one grouping of legendary "Three Emperors", namely Tian1 Huang2, Di4 Huang2, and Ren2 Huang2. These correspond to tian1, di4, ren2, the san1 cai2, or "Three Achievements" of creation: heaven, earth and people. They also often correspond to Fu2 Xi1, Sui4 Ren2, and Shen2 Nong2. The Book of Poems, (Shang Song) says tian1 ming4 xuan2 niao3, jiang er2 sheng1 shang1, and here is one of the more interesting tales: "Heaven mandated Xuan2 Niao3," (Queen Tun1 Ya4, the blackbird wife of Di4 Ku4), "down it came, gave birth to Shang". So born from a royal egg was Zi3 Xie4 who is the grand ancestor of both the much, much later Shang Dynasty and the clan of Confucius, albeit myriad generations later); Di4Ku4, father of Xia Dynasty founder Yao the Great, was son of Zhuan Xu (the Yellow Emperor's grandson). Legendary figures are often depicted in art as black birds or with crow-like attributes, magpie heads, etc. The many legends differ as to names, groupings, deeds etc. The Wu Di4 or "Five Emperors" vary by account but are typically Huang Di, his grandson Zhuan Xu, Di Ku, Yao2, Shun, and Yu3.

Furthermore, legend also has it that Lei2 Zu3, wife of the Yellow Emperor, taught the people how to raise silkworms, cultivate and spin silk, and so textile clothing replaced the animal skins and tree leaves worn up to that time.

Shun4 is therefore often called Yu2 Shun4 or simply Yu2. As for Yao2, he was originally made chief of Tao2 (Dingtao in modern Shandong) and expanded his rule to Tang2, (nowadays Linfeng in adjoining Shanxi), so he is also known in history as Tao2 Tang2 or Tang2 Yao2. According to legend, Yao2 passed on his throne to Shun4, who in turn abdicated to Yu3, the founder of the Xia4 Dynasty in the 21st Century BC, beginning the tradition of hereditary succession to the throne with his son Qi3.

		Zhou1 Fa1 in the original text refers to Ji1 Fa1, original personal name of the man who became Emperor Zhou1 Wu3 Wang2, who crushed the tyrant Zhou4, evil last ruler of the Shang Dynasty and founded the Zhou1, China"s longest lived dynasty, around 1100BC, roughly contemporary with King David of ancient Israel. Ji1, his surname, had also been that of the Yellow Emperor, taken from the nearby Ji1 River. Yin1 Tang1 refers to the much earlier destruction of Jie2, evil last ruler of the Xia Dynasty, by Cheng2 Tang1, and the later's founding of the Shang Dynasty around 1600 BC. Bad Kings Jie2 and Zhou4 are the notorious pair of evil last rulers, the first to lose the Mandate of Heaven, celebrated in many popular sayings such as "Jie2's dog barked at righteousness," and Zhou4's consort, Da2 Ji3 is reviled for her wild banquets, lust, cruelty and excesses. The tenth ruler of Shang, Pan2 Kang1 moved his capital to Yin1, hence in history and literature the Shang is often called Yin or Yin-Shang, and its founder is often known as Yin1 Tang1 or Shang1 Tang1.

Ping2 zhang1 to discuss and clarify (matters of the day, of state,); in later times, (Tang, Song) it became the name of a high office, councilor of state. Precedents: Shang Tang relied heavily on Yi1 Yin3 and took his advice; Zhou Wu Wang appointed Lv3 Shang4 to a high military post and empowered him to handle very grave matters. Confucius said that if anybody could fully explain the Way to him some morning, he would be able to die satisfied that night.

In subsequent times, li2 miao2 has had the non-literal meaning of masses as well, so I believe that here li2 shou3 is a "shuangguanyu'" meaning these darker peoples as well as the soiled, sunbaked masses. The Rong2 and Qiang1 were two tribes to the west. Together these represent all the unschooled common folk of various ethnicity as well as the tribes surrounding China in Zhou times; all the tribes in time pacified or otherwise brought around to China's civilized ways, to the way of the cultivated and correct Jun1zi3 ren2; they add their land and talented men to the Chinese state.

The constituent parts and functions of the body each correspond to one of these. Flesh, bones and hair belong to Earth, body fluids to Water, body temperature to Heat, and internal circulation to Wind. As for the Wu3 Chang2, these are the Confucian "Five Virtues": ren2, benevolence, human kindness; Yi4, righteousness, justice; Li3, ritual, propriety; Zhi4, wisdom, intelligence, and Xin4, truthfulness and trust. These are the traditional Confucianist regulating principles of social morality. As the bodily functions are governed by the former, our words and deeds are to be controlled in accordance with the latter.

With every new day comes a chance to reform... although Zhou was an old country, it was able to restore itself. (The Book of Poems, Greater Odes, Wen Wang) quoted in the Great Learning Chapter 2). de2 here means matching, befitting; neng2 here means ability and is similar to the English modal auxilliary can in that it covers broad potential, including mood of physical ability as well as other those of possibility and permission. "If I said I could not lift Mount Tai over the North Sea," said Mencius to King Xuan Wang of Qi, "could not would really mean due to a lack of ability. But if I said I couldn't break a long stick into smaller pieces, it would simply reflect unwillingness to let it happen." In other words, know what you can accomplish or change and what you can't, for whatever reason. Be self reliant but don't overreach yourself; don't promise what you cannot do. The San Zi Jing tells children of the one-time rascal Dou Yanshan, Dou4 Yan4 Shan1, who, still unmarried and childless after an early life of wrongdoing and wasting his family's fortune, suddenly grasped the ephemeral and treasured nature of an existance and managed to see the error of his ways. He took in and taught orphaned boys and produced five famous scholars, achieving fame and redeeming his parents' good name.

		The empty valleys broadly resonate; in hollow halls wisely officiate.
		</td>
		<td>
		In the earliest commentary extant today, from Li Xian of the Northern Wei, the empty valleys refer to an ancient story from the Spring and Autumn period in which a prince unfilally ran off into the wilderness valleys of Mt Fu to make his name heard. Instead of fame, he was fatally lost amidst echoes and trees, and his searching father the King set fire to the woods out of frustration and in hope of leading him back, thus sealing his fate. The lesson is that your place as a prince is in the palace, studying and achieving perfection as a son and brother, then speaking and ruling clearly; your name is formed inside the family, then rises in the world. Literal meanings of ting1 are listen, preside over, to judge, to govern, to rule, officiate, and here the meaning is to speak, to rule. Xi2 here means carefully; with clarity; clearly, in a studied and wise manner, reflecting perfect cultivation. The characters for hollowness and emptiness, abstruseness, add a Buddhist dimension, connoting the emptiness and illusory nature of worldly things, high and low. Sheng1 also refers to the Emperor's works and edicts, name etc, resounding far off in the wilderness. The Emperor's filial piety. Gain the hearts and minds of the world by serving your royal ancestors. Another analogy between nature and society; how to behave in the halls and vast chambers of power, as teacher of all tribes of men and universal giver of laws. All tribes of men everywhere depend on the One's (Son of Heaven's) perfection, his filial piety in particular. Conversely, bad news travels fast down among the people; what goes around comes around, so serve your elders and ancestors, speak, listen, reflect, study the classics and chant sutras, live and rule carefully in pursuit of perfection. This ties into the next line.

This is the Buddhist notion of Yin1 guo3, fatal cause and effect, and that of Yin1 yuan2 (the words are contraposed in the lines) in accord with our stored deeds. Not that the Chinese were without such ideas; proper kingly behavior (particularly in filial obeisance) was long before linked to the avoidance of disaster and the achievement of harmony. When the Qian Zi Wen was written, Buddhism, along with Confucianism and Daoism, was already one of the "Three Great Teachings," having been introduced from India about two to three centuries earlier during the Eastern (Later) Han Dynasty, when systematic religious Daoism had also come into being out of older beliefs. Tantric Buddhist amuletic chants and charm formulas of (sanskrit)Dharani (tuo2luo2ni2 in Chinese), for maximizing one's account of good and minimizing one's balance of evil, appeared in China as early as the 3rd cenury AD. They coexisted and syncretized (blended) harmoniously for the most part in the Liang state at the time of Zhou Xingsi's writing, with Confucianism dominant. The ethical system of Confucius did yet not have a large formal and exclusive metaphysical system, as was later created in the Northern Song, at its roots. It could probably coexist with any ideological or metaphysical basis, anything that has people sharing the same values; here we see a Buddhist precept adding a new dimension to the foundation of Confucian ethics. Emperor Liang Wu Di, who ordered the Qian Zi Wen created, patronized Buddhism heavily and had state monasteries, known as Liang2 Si4, or Liang Temples built, forseeing the Tang ("Restored Zhou" during her rule) Empress Wu's frenzied and extravagent building of State Temples and prosyletizing of Buddhism nearly two centuries later. Zhou Xingsi could be expected to say something about an important Buddhist teaching in a work called for by such a king, who late in his life actually took vows as a bonze. It was during the Liang, shortly after the Qian Zi Wen's creation that the Tian1 Tai2 Buddhist sect (Tendai in Japanese) was founded, on the Tian Tai mountain range in Zhejiang; Chi4 Cheng2, mentioned below in this work, is one of its peaks. The Japanese later named Mt Akagi, in present-day Gunma Prefecture, after it. "State-established Temple" building apread, first to Korea and then to Japan and was important in the development and spread of the very early Japanese state beginning on record with Shomu Tenno's edict in the 8th century AD. Buddhism was also very strong in the Southern Dynasty Liang's contemporary Northern Wei Dynasty; this Northern and Southern Dynasties period left many striking and priceless Buddhist relics and works of art.

		A foot of jade is no treasure; an inch of time is to fight for.

		<td>
		Time is life itself, the very unit of existance. Time is money. We struggle to meet a deadline; time is our lives flowing by never to return. Marlowe's Faust, his time up, comes to mind, pleading for "another minute, another second". Benjamin Franklin said "If you treasure life, then treasure time, for time is the very stuff of life itself." Lu Xun's protagonist in Kuangren Riji", "Diary of a Madman" and his delusion becomes interesting from the standpoint of time; if time is life, and labor is time, then people eat each other when they eat the fruits of labor, exploit their time, charge interest and so forth. The Chinese word for time here is guang1 yin1 or "bright (flash) yin energy", like "moonlight," rare and limited enough. Time is based on heaven's periods of brightness, around which people arrange their activities in life and government, in using the blessings and fertility of earth. An old Chinese saying goes yi1 cun4 guang1 yin1, yi1 cun4 jin1, cun4 jin1 nan2 mai3 cun4 guang1 yin1: "An inch of time, an inch of gold, it's pretty hard for that inch of gold to buy an inch of time!" Still, today, it's time that people contend for.

		zi1 fu4 shi4 jun1, yue1 yan2 yu3 jing4

		<td>
		Nourish your father and serve your king; known as reverence and respect.
		</td>
		<td>
		Zi4 means to support, with the sense of nourish here. Shi4 is verbal here, meaning to serve as child or subject, to work on the parent or ruler's behalf, when alive, and to offer prayer when departed. Yan2 here is verbal, as in the ancient meaning of yan2 fu4, revere your father, meaning revere and respect one's parents by supporting and worshipping them, for nothing is greater than their continuance of the male line, "kneeling before and nourishing your living parents is called (yue1) yan2 (Xiao Jing, 9) and this reverent duty, "yan" is the model for service to one's ruler, respect, or jing4. The ancient sages gently taught "respect" (jing4) through filial reverence and duty (yan2); it came naturally to them. Your mother gets your love and your ruler gets your respect; only your father gets both. From filial piety, the above yan2 and jing4, also comes zhong1, or, loyalty, which transfers to serving one's ruler. Fulfilled filial duty to the father brings the blessed light of heaven, that to mother brings the fertile blessings of earth. From the Junzi's filial piety comes the quality of loyalty to ruler. One's character forms in the home with filiality, and then one's name rises in the world. This line and the next ones deal with the delicate balance between conflicting obligations: private and public, family and State.
