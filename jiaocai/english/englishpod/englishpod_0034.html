       This  is  Madeline Wright,   for  BCC News  reporting  live from  Washington D. C.  where,   very  shortly,   the  new  President  will deliver  his inaugural address.   Just  moments  ago,   the  President was  sworn in to office;   following  the United States Constitution  the  president  swore  an  oath  to  faithfully  execute  the  office of  the presidency.

Now  we're  waiting for  the  President  to  take to the stage and  deliver   his   speech.    Tom,   it's  like  a  who's who of  the  political world here  on  Capital Hill,   with  dignitaries   representing   several different  countries.
