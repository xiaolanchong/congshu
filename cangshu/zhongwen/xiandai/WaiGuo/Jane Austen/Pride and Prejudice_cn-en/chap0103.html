<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her
five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw
from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.
They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,
ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the
skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the
second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas.  Her
report was highly favourable.  Sir William had been delighted
with him.  He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next
assembly with a large party.  Nothing could be more delightful!
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in
love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were
entertained.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">尽管班纳特太太有了五个女儿帮腔，向她丈夫<BR>

不能叫她满意。母女们想尽办法对付他：赤裸<BR>
裸的问句，巧妙的设想，离题很远的猜测，什<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat
about ten minutes with him in his library.  He had entertained
hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of
whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the
advantage of ascertaining, from an upper window, that he wore a
blue coat and rode a black horse.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">不到几天功夫，彬格莱先生上门回拜班纳特先<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and
already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do
credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which
deferred it all.  Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the
following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of
their invitation, &amp;c.  Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.  She
could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon
after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and
never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.  Lady Lucas
quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being
gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a
report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve
ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.  The girls
grieved over such a large number of ladies; but were comforted
the day before the ball by hearing that, instead of twelve, he
had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and
a cousin.  And when the party entered the assembly room, it
consisted of only five altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two
sisters, the husband of the oldest, and another young man.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">斑府上不久就发请贴请他吃饭；班纳特太太已<BR>
经计划了好几道菜，每道菜都足以增加她的体<BR>
面，说明她是个会当家的贤主妇，可是事不凑<BR>
巧，彬格莱先生第二天非进城不可，他们这一<BR>
番盛意叫他无法领情，因此回信给他们，说是<BR>
要迟一迟再说。班纳特太太大为不安。她想，<BR>
此人刚来到哈福德郡，怎么就要进城有事，于<BR>
是她开始担心思了；照理他应该在尼日斐花园<BR>
安安定定住下来，看现在的情形，莫不是他经<BR>
常都得这样东漂西泊，行踪不定？亏得卢卡斯<BR>
太太对她说，可能他是到伦敦去邀请那一大群<BR>
客人来参加舞会，这才使她稍许减除了一些顾<BR>
虑。外面马上就纷纷传说彬格莱先生并没有带<BR>
来十二个女宾，仅仅只带来六个，其中五个是<BR>
他自己的姐妹，一个是表姐妹，这个消息才使<BR>
小姐们放了心。后来等到这群贵客走进舞场的<BR>
时候，却一共只有五个人：彬格莱先生，他的<BR>
两个姐妹，姐夫，还有另外一个青年。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike; he had a
pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.  His
brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his
friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his
fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the
report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.  The
gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the
ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he
was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening,
till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his
popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his
company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate
in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be
compared with his friend.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱先生仪表堂堂，大有绅士风度，而且和<BR>
颜悦色，没有拘泥做作的气习。他的姐妹也都<BR>
是些优美的女性，态度落落大方他的姐夫赫斯<BR>
脱只不过像个普通绅士，不大引人注目，但是<BR>
他的朋友达西却立刻引起全场的注意，因为他<BR>
身材魁伟，眉清目秀，举止高贵，于是他进场<BR>
不到五分钟，大家都纷纷传说他每年有一万磅<BR>
的收入。男宾们都称赞他的一表人才，女宾们<BR>
都说他比彬格莱先生漂亮得多。人们差不多有<BR>
半个晚上都带着爱慕的目光看着他最后人们才<BR>
发现他为人骄傲，看不起人，巴结不上他，因<BR>
此对他起了厌恶的感觉，他那众望所归的极成<BR>
盛一时的场面才黯然失色。他既然摆起那么一<BR>
副讨人嫌惹人厌的面貌，那么，不管他在德比<BR>
郡有多大的财产，也挽救不了他，况且和他的<BR>
朋友比起来，他更没有什么大不了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the
principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,
danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,
and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.  Such amiable
qualities must speak for themselves.  What a contrast between
him and his friend!  Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to
any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking
about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided.  He was the proudest, most
disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he
would never come there again.  Amongst the most violent against
him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was
sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one
of her daughters.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱先生很快就熟悉了全场所有的主要人物<BR>
。他生气勃勃，为人又不拘泥，每一场舞都可<BR>
以少不了要跳。使他气恼的是，舞会怎么散场<BR>
得这样早。他又谈起他自己要在尼日斐花园开<BR>
一次舞会。他这些可爱的地方自然会引起人家<BR>
对他发生好感。他跟他的朋友是多么显著的对<BR>
照啊！达西先生只跟赫斯脱太太跳了一次舞，<BR>
跟彬格莱小姐跳了一次舞，此外就在室内踱来<BR>
踱去，偶而找他自己人谈谈，人家要介绍他跟<BR>
别的小姐跳舞，他怎么也不肯。大家都断定他<BR>
是世界上最骄傲，最讨人厌的人，希望他不要<BR>
再来。其中对他反感最厉害的是班纳特太太，<BR>
她对他的整个举止都感到讨厌，而且这种讨厌<BR>
竟变本加厉，形成了一种特殊的气愤，因为他<BR>
得罪了他的一个女儿。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of
gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of
that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her
to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who
came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend
to join it.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I certainly shall not.  You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner.  At such an assembly

a punishment to me to stand up with."

consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles,
for you are wasting your time with me."

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Bingley followed his advice.  Mr. Darcy walked off; and
Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends;
for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in
any thing ridiculous.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱先生依了达西先生的话走开以后，达西<BR>
自己也走开了。伊丽莎白依旧坐在那里，对达<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole
family.  Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired
by the Netherfield party.  Mr. Bingley had danced with her
twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane was
as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a
quieter way.  Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.  Mary had heard
herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl
in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all
that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.  They returned
therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they
lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.  They
found Mr. Bennet still up.  With a book, he was regardless of
time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of
curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such
splendid expectations.  He had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found
that he had a very different story to hear.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班府上全家上这一个晚上大致都过得很高兴。<BR>
大小姐蒙彬格莱先生先生邀她跳了两次舞，而<BR>
且这位贵人的姐妹们都对她另眼相看。班太太<BR>
看到尼日斐花园的一家人都这么喜爱她的大女<BR>
儿，觉得非常得意。吉英跟她母亲一样得意，<BR>
只不过没有象她母亲那样声张。伊丽莎白也为<BR>
吉英快活。曼丽曾听到人们在彬格莱小姐面前<BR>
提到她自己，说她是邻近一带最有才干的姑娘<BR>
；咖苔琳和丽迪雅运气最好，没有那一场舞缺<BR>
少舞伴，这是她们每逢开舞会时唯一关心的一<BR>
件事。母女们高高兴兴地回到她们所住的浪搏<BR>
恩村（她们算是这个村子里的旺族），看见班<BR>
纳特先生还没有睡觉。且说这位先生平常只要<BR>
捧上一本书，就忘了时间，可是这次他没有睡<BR>
觉，却是因为他极想知道大家朝思暮想的这一<BR>
盛会，经过情形究竟如何。他满以为他太太对<BR>
那位贵客一定很失望，但是，他立刻就发觉事<BR>
实并非如此。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have
had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.  I wish
you had been there.  Jane was so admired, nothing could be like
it.  Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley
thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.  Only
think of <I>that</I> my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and
she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.  First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.  I was so vexed to
see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her
at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite
struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.  So, he
enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the
two next.  Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and
the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger -- "
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢！我的好老爷，”她一走进房间就这么说<BR>
，“我们这一个晚上过得太快活了，舞会太好<BR>
了。你没有去真可惜。吉英那么吃香，简直是<BR>
无法形容。什么人都说她长得好；彬格莱先生<BR>
认为她很美，跟她跳了两场舞！你光想想这一<BR>
点看吧，亲爱的；他确实跟她跳了两场！全场<BR>
那么多女宾，就只有她一个人蒙受了他两次邀<BR>
请。他头一场舞是邀请卢卡斯小姐跳的。我看<BR>
到他站到她身边去，不禁有些气恼！不过，他<BR>
对她根本没意思，其实，什么人也不会对她有<BR>
意思；当吉英走下舞池的时候，他可就显得非<BR>
常着迷了。他立刻打听她的姓名，请人介绍，<BR>
然后邀她跳下一场舞。他第三场舞是跟金小姐<BR>
跳的，第四场跟玛丽雅・卢卡斯跳，第五场又<BR>
跟吉英跳，第六场是跟丽萃跳，还有‘布朗谢<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"If he had had any compassion for <I>me</I>," cried her husband
impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much!  For God's
sake, say no more of his partners.  Oh!  that he had sprained
his ankle in the first dance!"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“要是他稍许体谅我一点，”她的丈夫不耐烦<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  my dear," continued Mrs. Bennet, "I am quite delighted
with him.  He is so excessively handsome!  and his sisters are
charming women.  I never in my life saw any thing more elegant
than their dresses.  I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's
gown -- "
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢！亲爱的，”班纳特太太接下去说，“我<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Here she was interrupted again.  Mr. Bennet protested against
any description of finery.  She was therefore obliged to seek
another branch of the subject, and related, with much
bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking
rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她说到这里又给岔断了。班纳特先生不愿意听<BR>
人谈到衣饰。她因此不得不另找话题，于是就<BR>
谈到达西先生那不可一世的傲慢无礼的态度，<BR>
她的措辞辛辣刻薄，而又带几分夸张。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose
much by not suiting <I>his</I> fancy; for he is a most disagreeable,
horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.  So high and so
conceited that there was no enduring him!  He walked here, and
he walked there, fancying himself so very great!  Not handsome
enough to dance with!  I wish you had been there, my dear, to
have given him one of your set downs.  I quite detest the man."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不过我可以告诉你，”她补充道，“丽萃不<BR>
中他的意，这对丽萃并没有什么可惜，因为他<BR>
是个最讨厌、最可恶的人不值得去奉承他。那<BR>
么高傲，那么自大，叫人不可容忍！他一会儿<BR>
走到这里，一会儿走到那里，把自己看得那么<BR>
了不起！还要嫌人家不够漂亮，配不上跟他跳<BR>
舞呢！要是你在场的话，你就可以好好地教训<BR>
他一顿。我厌恶透了那个人。”<BR></TD>
