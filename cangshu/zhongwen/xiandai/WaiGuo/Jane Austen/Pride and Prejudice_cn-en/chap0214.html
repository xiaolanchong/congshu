The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr.
Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them
his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing
intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as
tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene
so lately gone through at Rosings.  To Rosings he then hastened,
to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her
ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make
her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.

那两位先生第二天早上就离开了罗新斯；柯林<br>
斯先生在门房附近等着给他们送行，送行以后<br>
，他带了一个好消息回家来，说是这两位贵客<br>
虽然刚刚在罗新斯满怀离愁，身体却很健康，<br>
精神也很饱满。然后他又赶到罗新斯去安慰珈<br>
苔琳夫人母女；回家去的时候，他又得意非凡<br>
地把咖苔琳夫人的口信带回来──说夫人觉得<br>
非常沉闷，极希望他们全家去同他一块吃饭。

Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,
had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to
her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of
what her ladyship's indignation would have been.  "What would
she have said? how would she have behaved?" were questions with
which she amused herself.

伊丽莎白看到咖苔琳夫人，就不禁想起：要是<br>
自己愿意跟达西要好，现在已经成了夫人的没<br>
有过门的侄媳妇了；而且她想到夫人那时将会<br>
怎样气愤，就不禁好笑。她不断地想出这样一<br>
些话来跟自己打趣：“她将会说些什么话呢？<br>
她将会有些什么举动呢？”

Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.
"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I
believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do.  But
I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to
be so much attached to me!  They were excessively sorry to go!
But so they always are.  The dear Colonel rallied his spirits
tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most
acutely, more, I think, than last year.  His attachment to
Rosings certainly increases."

他们一开头就谈到罗新斯佳宾星散的问题。咖<br>
苔琳夫人说：“告诉你，我真十分难受。我相<br>
信，谁也不会象我一样，为亲友的离别而伤心<br>
得这么厉害。我特别喜欢这两个年轻人，我知<br>
道他们也非常喜欢我。他们临去的时候真舍不<br>
得走。他们一向都是那样。那位可爱的上校到<br>
最后才算打起了精神；达西看上去最难过，我<br>
看他比去年还要难受，他对罗新斯的感情真是<br>
一年比一年来得深。”

Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed
out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself,
by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon,
she added:

吃过中饭以后，咖苔琳夫人看到班纳特小姐好<br>

"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg

replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.
I must be in town next Saturday."

"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.  I
expected you to stay two months.  I told Mrs. Collins so before
you came.  There can be no occasion for your going so soon.
Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
“哎哟，这么说来，你在这儿只能住六个星期<br>
啦。我本来指望你待上两个月的。你没有来以<br>

"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.  And if
you will stay another <u>month</u> complete, it will be in my power
to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early
in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the
barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--and
indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not
object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."

“噢，只要你妈妈让你，爸爸自然会让你的。<br>
做爸爸的决不会象妈妈一样，把女儿当做宝贝<br>
看待。我六月初要去伦敦待一个星期；要是你<br>
能再住满一个月，我就可以把你们两个人当中<br>
顺便带一个人去，涛生既不反对驾四轮马车，<br>
那自然可以宽宽敞敞地带上你们一个；要是天<br>

Lady Catherine seemed resigned.  "Mrs. Collins, you must send
a servant with them.  You know I always speak my mind, and I
cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by
themselves.  It is highly improper.  You must contrive to send
somebody.  I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort
of thing.  Young women should always be properly guarded and
attended, according to their situation in life.  When my niece
Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her
having two men-servants go with her.  Miss Darcy, the daughter
of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have
appeared with propriety in a different manner.  I am excessively
attentive to all those things.  You must send John with the young
ladies, Mrs. Collins.  I am glad it occurred to me to mention it;
for it would really be discreditable to <u>you</u> to let them go
alone."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
咖苔琳夫人不便强留，便说道：“柯林斯太太<br>
，你得打发一个佣人送她们。我说话一向心直<br>
口快，我不放心让两位年轻的小姐赶远路。这<br>
太不象话了，我最看不惯的就是这种事，你千<br>
万得派一个人送送她们。对于年轻的小姐们，<br>
我们总得照着她们的身份好好是照顾她们，待<br>
候她们。我的姨侄女儿乔治安娜去年夏天上拉<br>
姆斯盖特去的时候，我非得要她有两个男佣人<br>
伴送不可。要知道，她身为彭伯里的达西先生<br>
和安妮夫人的千金小姐，不那样便难免有失体<br>
统。我对于这一类的事特别留意。你得打发约<br>
翰送送这两位小姐才好，柯林斯太太。幸亏我<br>
发觉了这件事，及时指出，否则让她们孤零零<br>
地自个儿走，把你的面子也丢光了。”

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their
journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was
necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with
a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she
was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a
day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge
in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
提到她们的旅程，咖苔琳夫人还有许多话要问<br>
，而且她并不完全都是自问自答，因此你必须<br>
留心去听，伊丽莎白倒觉得这是她的运气，否<br>
则，她这么心事重重，一定会忘了自己作客身<br>
份呢。有心事应该等到单独一个人的时候再去<br>
想。每逢没有第二个人跟她在一起的时候，她<br>
就翻来复去地想个痛快；她没有哪一天不独个<br>
儿散步，一边走一边老是回想着那些不愉快的<br>
事情。

Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by
heart.  She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its
writer were at times widely different.  When she remembered the
style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when
she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,
her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed
feelings became the object of compassion.  His attachment
excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could
not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.  In
her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation
and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject
of yet heavier chagrin.  They were hopeless of remedy.  Her father,
contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to
restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her
mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely
insensible of the evil.  Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane
in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;
but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what
chance could there be of improvement?  Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless,
would scarcely give them a hearing.  They were ignorant, idle, and
vain.  While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt
with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they
would be going there forever.

达西那封信，她简直快要背得出了。她把每一<br>
句话都反复研究过，她对于这个写信人的感情<br>
，一忽儿热了起来，一忽儿又冷了下去。记起<br>
他那种笔调口吻，她到现在还是说不尽的气愤<br>
；可是只要一想到以前怎样错怪了他，错骂了<br>
他，她的气愤便转到自己身上来了。他那沮丧<br>
的情绪反而引起了她的同情。他的爱恋引起了<br>
她的感激，他的性格引起了她的尊敬；可是她<br>
无法对他发生好感，她拒绝他以后，从来不曾<br>
有过片刻的后悔，她根本不想再看到他。她经<br>
常为自己以往的行为感到苦恼和悔恨，家庭里<br>
面种种不幸的缺陷更叫她苦闷万分。这些缺陷<br>
是无法补救的。她父亲对这些缺陷只是一笑置<br>
之，懒得去约束他那几个小女儿的狂妄轻率的<br>
作风；至于她母亲，她本身既是作风失检，当<br>
然完全不会感觉到这方面的危害。伊丽莎白常<br>
常和吉英合力同心，约束咖苔琳和丽迪雅的冒<br>
失，可是，母亲既然那么纵容她们，她们还会<br>
有什么长进的机会？咖苔琳意志薄弱，容易气<br>
恼，她完全听凭丽迪雅指挥，一听到吉英和伊<br>
丽莎白的规劝就要生气；丽迪雅却固执任性，<br>
粗心大意，她听也不要听她们的话。这两个妹<br>
妹既无知，又懒惰，又爱虚荣，只要麦里屯来<br>
了一个军官，她们就去跟他勾搭。麦里屯跟浪<br>
搏恩本来相隔不远，她们一天到晚往那儿跑。

Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and
Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former
good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.  His
affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct
cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness
of his confidence in his friend.  How grievous then was the
thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so
replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
她还有一桩大心事，那就是替吉英担忧；达西<br>
先生的解释固然使她对彬格莱先生恢复了以往<br>
的好感，同时也就越发感觉到吉英受到的损失<br>
太大。彬格莱对吉英一往情深，他的行为不应<br>
该受到任何指责，万一要指责的话，最多也只<br>
能怪他过分信任朋友。吉英有了这样理想的一<br>
个机会，既可以得到种种好处，又可望获得终<br>
身幸福，只可惜家里人愚蠢失检，把这个机会<br>
断送了，叫人想起来怎不痛心！

When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which
had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to
make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

每逢回想起这些事情，难免不连想到韦翰品格<br>

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last
week of her stay as they had been at first.  The very last evening
was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into
the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the
best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of
placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself
obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and
pack her trunk afresh.
