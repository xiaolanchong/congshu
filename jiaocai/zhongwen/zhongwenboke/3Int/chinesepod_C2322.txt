A:

哎，张小虎这人怎么这样啊？

āi, Zhāng Xiǎohǔ zhè rén zěnme zhèyàng a?

Hey, what's up with that guy Zhang Xiaohu?

B:

怎么了？

zěnmele?

What's up?

A:

上周我请他帮忙弄两张票，他很爽快地答应了。结果到现在都没弄到。

shàngzhōu wǒ qǐng tā bāngmáng nòng liǎng zhāng piào, tā hěn shuǎngkuài de dāying le. jiéguǒ dào xiànzài dōu méi nòng dào.

Last week I asked him to help me get two tickets, and he agreed to help immediately. But now, he still hasn't done it.

B:

你再问问他，可能他太忙，忘了。

nǐ zài wèn wen tā, kěnéng tā tài máng, wàng le.

Ask him again. Maybe he's too busy or he forgot.

A:

我问过他好几次了。他都说没问题包在他身上，让我等着就行了。我也知道这个票很难弄，如果他弄不到，可以跟我说啊。

wǒ wèn guo tā hǎo jǐ cì le. tā dōu shuō méiwèntí bāo zài tā shēnshàng, ràng wǒ děng zhe jiù xíng le. wǒ yě zhīdào zhè gè piào hěn nán nòng, rúguǒ tā nòngbudào, kěyǐ gēn wǒ shuō a.

I've asked him a bunch of times. He always says it's no problem and he's got it. All I've got to do is wait. I know that this ticket is really hard to get. If he can't get it, he can talk with me about it.

B:

他是北方人吧？北方人比较爱面子，一般不会直接拒绝别人。

tā shì běifāngrén ba? běifāngrén bǐjiào ài miànzi, yībān bùhuì zhíjiē jùjué biérén.

Is he a Northerner? Northern people like to keep up appearances. Usually they won't directly refuse someone.

A:

嗯，他好像是北方人。

ng4, tā hǎoxiàng shì běifāngrén.

Yeah. I think he's a Northerner.

B:

跟北方人比，南方人就比较小心谨慎。如果做不到，就不会答应别人。

Compared to Northerners, Southerners are more cautious. If they can't do something, then they won't agree to do it.

A:

你说得对。李燕就是南方人，每次我找她帮忙，她都要考虑很久。给我的感觉就是不太想帮我。

nǐ shuō de duì. Lǐ Yàn jiùshì nánfāngrén, měicì wǒ zhǎo tā bāngmáng, tā dōu yào kǎolǜ hěn jiǔ. gěi wǒ de gǎnjué jiùshì bùtài xiǎng bāng wǒ.

You're right. Li Yan is a Southerner, and every time I ask her to help, she always thinks about it for a long time. It gives me the feeling that she doesn't really want to help me.

B:

行了，你别郁闷了，以后有什么事尽管来找我。

xíng le, nǐ bié yùmèn le, yǐhòu yǒu shénme shì jǐnguǎn lái zhǎo wǒ.

That's enough. Don't get depressed. In the future, if you've got something, try to come find me.

哦，那你是南方人还是北方人？

这个……
