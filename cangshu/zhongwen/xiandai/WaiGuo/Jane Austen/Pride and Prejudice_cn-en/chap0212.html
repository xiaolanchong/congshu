<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and
meditations which had at length closed her eyes.  She could not
yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was
impossible to think of any thing else, and, totally indisposed
for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge
herself in air and exercise.  She was proceeding directly to
her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the
park, she turned up the lane which led her farther from the
turnpike road.  The park paling was still the boundary on one
side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白昨夜一直深思默想到合上眼睛为止，<BR>
今天一大早醒来，心头又涌起了这些深思默想<BR>
。她仍然对那桩事感到诧异，无法想到别的事<BR>
情上去；她根本无心做事，于是决定一吃过早<BR>
饭就出去好好地透透空气，散散步。她正想往<BR>
那条心爱的走道上走走去，忽然想到达西先生<BR>
有时候也上那儿来，于是便住了步。她没有进<BR>
花园，却走上那条小路，以便和那条有栅门的<BR>
大路隔得远些。她仍旧沿着花园的围栅走，不<BR>
久便走过了一道园门。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">After walking two or three times along that part of the lane,
she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at
the gates and look into the park.  The five weeks which she had
now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country,
and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.
She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a
glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the
park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being
Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.  But the person who
advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward
with eagerness, pronounced her name.  She had turned away, but
on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to
be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.  He had by that
time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she
instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting
you.  Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?" -- And
then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and
was soon out of sight.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她沿着这一段小路来回走了两三遍，禁不住被<BR>
那清晨的美景吸引得在园门前停住了，朝园里<BR>

正要继续走下去，忽然看到花园旁的小林子里<BR>
有一个男人正朝这儿走来；她怕是达西先生，<BR>
便立刻往回走。但是那人已经走得很近，可以<BR>
看得见她了；只见那人急急忙忙往前跑，一面<BR>
还叫着她的名字。她本来已经掉过头来走开，<BR>
一听到有人叫她的名字，虽然明知是达西先生<BR>
，也只得走回到园门边来。达西这时候也已经<BR>
来到园门口，拿出一封信递给她，她不由自主<BR>
地收下了。他带着一脸傲慢而从容的神气说道<BR>
：“我已经在林子里踱了好一会儿，希望碰到<BR>
你，请你赏个脸，看看这封信，好不好？”于<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest
curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still
increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets
of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close
hand. -- The envelope itself was likewise full. -- Pursuing her
way along the lane, she then began it.  It was dated from
Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of
equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.  The first
mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either,
I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister; -- and the other,
that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of
honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and
blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. -- Wilfully and wantonly
to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up
to expect its exertion, would be a depravity to which the
separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the
growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. -- But
from the severity of that blame which was last night so
liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in future secured, when the following account of my
actions and their motives has been read. -- If, in the
explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the
necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to
your's, I can only say that I am sorry. -- The necessity must
be obeyed -- and farther apology would be absurd. -- I had not
been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other
young woman in the country. -- But it was not till the evening
of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his
feeling a serious attachment. -- I had often seen him in love
before. -- At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with
you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's
accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your
sister had given rise to a general expectation of their
marriage.  He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time
alone could be undecided.  From that moment I observed my
friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that
his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever
witnessed in him.  Your sister I also watched. -- Her look and
manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without
any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from
the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment. -- If <I>you</I> have not been mistaken here, <I>I</I> must
have been in an error.  Your superior knowledge of your sister
must make the latter probable. -- If it be so, if I have been
misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment
has not been unreasonable.  But I shall not scruple to assert
that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such
as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that,
however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be
easily touched. -- That I was desirous of believing her
indifferent is certain, -- but I will venture to say that my
investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my
hopes or fears. -- I did not believe her to be indifferent
because I wished it; -- I believed it on impartial conviction,
as truly as I wished it in reason. -- My objections to the
marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged
to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my
own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil
to my friend as to me. -- But there were other causes of
repugnance; -- causes which, though still existing, and
existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself
endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me. -- These causes must be stated, though briefly. -- The
situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was
nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so
frequently, so almost uniformly, betrayed by herself, by your
three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. --
Pardon me. -- It pains me to offend you.  But amidst your
concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as
to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less
generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is
honourable to the sense and disposition of both. -- I will only
say farther that, from what passed that evening, my opinion of
all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened,
which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what
I esteemed a most unhappy connection. -- He left Netherfield
for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain,
remember, with the design of soon returning. --

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">你昨夜曾把两件性质不同、轻重不等的罪名加<BR>
在我头上。你第一件指责我折散了彬格莱先生<BR>
和令奶的好事，完全不顾他们俩之间如何情深<BR>
意切，你第二件指责我不顾体面，丧尽人道，<BR>
蔑视别人的权益，毁坏了韦翰先生那指日可期<BR>
的富贵，又破来了他美好的前途。我竟无情无<BR>
义，抛弃了自己小时候的朋友，一致公认的先<BR>
父生前的宠幸，一个无依无靠的青年，从小起<BR>
就指望我们施恩──这方面的确是我的一种遗<BR>
憾；至于那一对青年男女，他们不过只有几星<BR>
期的交情，就算我拆散了他们，也不能同这件<BR>
罪过相提并论。现在请允许我把我自己的行为<BR>
和动机一一剖白一下，希望你弄明白了其中的<BR>
原委以后，将来可以不再象昨天晚上那样对我<BR>
严词苛责。在解释这些必要的事情时，如果我<BR>
迫不得已，要述述我自己的情绪，因而使你情<BR>
绪不快，我只得向你表示歉意。既是出于迫不<BR>
得已，那么再道歉未免就嫌可笑了。我到哈福<BR>
德郡不久，就和别人一样，看出了彬格莱先生<BR>
在当地所有的少女中偏偏看中了令姐。但是一<BR>
直等到在尼日斐花园开跳舞会的那个晚上，我<BR>
才顾虑到他当真对令姐有了爱恋之意。说到他<BR>
的恋爱方面，我以前也看得很多。在那次跳舞<BR>
会上，当我很荣幸地跟你跳舞时，我才听到威<BR>
廉・卢卡斯偶然说起彬格莱先生对令姐的殷勤<BR>
已经弄得满城风雨，大家都以为他们就要谈到<BR>
嫁娶问题。听他说起来，好象事情已经千稳万<BR>
妥，只是迟早问题罢了。从那时起，我就密切<BR>
注意着我朋友的行为，于是我看出了他对班纳<BR>
特小姐的钟情，果然和他往常的恋爱情形大不<BR>
相同。我也注意着令姐。她的神色和风度依旧<BR>
象平常那样落落大方，和蔼可亲，并没有钟情<BR>
于任何人的迹象。根据我那一晚上仔细观察的<BR>
情形看来，我确实认为她虽然乐意接受他的殷<BR>
勤，可是她并没有用深情密意来报答他。要是<BR>
这件事你没有弄错，那么错处一定在我；你对<BR>
于令姐既有透辟的了解，那么当然可能是我错<BR>
了。倘若事实果真如此，倘若果真是我弄错了<BR>
，迟到造成令姐的痛苦，那当然难怪你气愤。<BR>
可是我可以毫不犹豫地说，令姐当初的风度极<BR>
其洒脱，即使观察力最敏锐的人，也难免以为<BR>
；她尽管性情柔和，可是她的心不容易打动。<BR>
我当初确实希望她无动于中，可是我敢说，我<BR>
虽然主观上有我的希望，有我的顾虑，可是我<BR>
的观察和我的推断并不会受到主观上的影响。<BR>
我认为，令姐决不会因为我希望她无动于中，<BR>
她就当真无动于中；我的看法大公无私，我的<BR>
愿望也合情合理。我昨天晚上说，遇到这样门<BR>
户不相称的婚姻，轮到我自己身上的时候，我<BR>
必须用极大的感情上的力量圆心压制，至于说<BR>
到他们俩这一门婚姻，我所以要反对，还不光<BR>
光是为了这些理由，因为关于门户高低的问题<BR>
，我朋友并不象我那么重视。我所以反对这门<BR>
婚姻，还有别的一些叫人嫌忌的原因───这<BR>
些原因虽然到现在还存在，而且在两桩事里面<BR>
同样存在着，可是我早就尽力把它忘了，因为<BR>
好在眼不见为净。这里必须把这些原因说一说<BR>
，即使简单地说一说也好。你母亲娘家亲族虽<BR>
然叫人不太满意，可是比起你们自己家里人那<BR>
种完全没有体统的情形来，便简直显得无足轻<BR>
重。你三个妹妹都是始终一贯地做出许多没有<BR>
体统的事情来，有时候甚至连你父亲也难免。<BR>
请原谅我这样直言无讳，其实得罪了你，也使<BR>
我自己感到。痉你的骨肉至亲有了这些缺点，<BR>
当然会使你感到难受，我这样一说，当然会叫<BR>
你更不高兴，可是你只要想一想，你自己和你<BR>
姐姐举止优雅，人家非得没有责难到你们俩头<BR>
上，而且对你们褒奖备至，还赏识你们俩的见<BR>
识和个性，这对于你究竟还不失为一种安慰吧<BR>
。我还想跟你说一说；我那天晚上看了那种情<BR>
形，不禁越发确定了我对各个人的看法，越发<BR>
加深了我的偏见，觉得一定要阻止我的朋友，<BR>
不让他缔结这门最不幸的婚姻。他第二天就离<BR>
开尼日斐花园到伦敦去了，我相信你一定记得<BR>
，他本来打算去一下便立刻回来。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The part which I acted is now to be explained. -- His
sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own;
our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike
sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their
brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
London. -- We accordingly went -- and there I readily engaged
in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils
of such a choice. -- I described, and enforced them
earnestly. -- But, however this remonstrance might have
staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that
it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not
been seconded by the assurance, which I hesitated not in
giving, of your sister's indifference.  He had before believed
her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,
regard. -- But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a
stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. -- To
convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no
very difficult point.  To persuade him against returning into
Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was
scarcely the work of a moment. -- I cannot blame myself for
having done thus much.  There is but one part of my conduct in
the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction;
it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far
as to conceal from him your sister's being in town.  I knew it
myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is
even yet ignorant of it. -- That they might have met without
ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; -- but his regard did
not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without
some danger. -- Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was
beneath me. -- It is done, however, and it was done for the
best. -- On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other
apology to offer.  If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it
was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me
may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet
learnt to condemn them. --

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">我得在这里把我当初参与这件事的经过说明一<BR>
下。原来他的姐妹们当时跟我一样，深为这件<BR>

来，于是决定立刻动身。我们就这样走了。到<BR>

那么十拿九稳地说，你姐姐对他并没有什么倾<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having
injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you
the whole of his connection with my family.  Of what he has
<I>particularly</I> accused me, I am ignorant; but of the truth of
what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of
undoubted veracity.  Mr. Wickham is the son of a very
respectable man, who had for many years the management of all
the Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge
of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to
him; and on George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness
was therefore liberally bestowed.  My father supported him at
school, and afterwards at Cambridge; -- most important
assistance, as his own father, always poor from the
extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a
gentleman's education.  My father was not only fond of this
young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had
also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be
his profession, intended to provide for him in it.  As for
myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of
him in a very different manner.  The vicious propensities --
the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the
knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation
of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had
opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which
Mr. Darcy could not have.  Here again I shall give you pain --
to what degree you only can tell.  But whatever may be the
sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their
nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character.
It adds even another motive.  My excellent father died about
five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the
last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
profession might allow, and, if he took orders, desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became
vacant.  There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.  His
own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year
from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having
finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not
think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate
pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment by which he
could not be benefited.  He had some intention, he added, of
studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one
thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.
I rather wished than believed him to be sincere; but, at any
rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.  I knew
that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.  The business was
therefore soon settled.  He resigned all claim to assistance in
the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a
situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand
pounds.  All connection between us seemed now dissolved.  I
thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his
society in town.  In town, I believe, he chiefly lived, but his
studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from
all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease
of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,
he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.  His
circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in
believing it, were exceedingly bad.  He had found the law a
most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on
being ordained, if I would present him to the living in
question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt,
as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide
for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's
intentions.  You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply
with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse
of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself.  After this
period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt.  How he
lived I know not.  But last summer he was again most painfully
obtruded on my notice.  I must now mention a circumstance which
I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less
than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.
Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.  My
sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the
guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and
myself.  About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an
establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she
went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and
thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for
there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily
deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended
himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a
strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she
was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an
elopement.  She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse;
and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add that I owed
the knowledge of it to herself.  I joined them unexpectedly a
day or two before the intended elopement; and then Georgiana,
unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother
whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the
whole to me.  You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public
exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her
charge.  Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot
help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a
strong inducement.  His revenge would have been complete
indeed.

习遮掩起来，不让他最好的朋友觉察，可是究<BR>
竟逃不过一个和他年龄相仿佛的青年人的眼睛<BR>
，他一个不提防就给我瞧见了漏洞，机会多的<BR>
是──当然老达西先生决不会不这种机会。这<BR>
里我不免又要引起你的痛苦了，痛苦到什么地<BR>
步，只有你自己知道。不论韦翰先生已经引起<BR>
了你何等样的感情，我却要怀疑到这些感情的<BR>
本质，因而我也就不得不对你说明他真正的品<BR>
格。这里面甚至还难免别有用心。德高望重的<BR>
先父大约去世于五年前，他宠爱韦翰先生始终<BR>
如一，连遗嘱上也特别向我提到他，要我斟酌<BR>
他的职业情况，极力提拔他，要是他受了圣职<BR>
，俸禄优厚的位置一有空缺，就让他替补上去<BR>
。另外还给了他一千磅遗产。他自己的父亲不<BR>
久也去世了；这几桩大事发生以后，不出半年<BR>
工夫，韦翰先生就写信跟我说，他已最后下定<BR>
决心，不愿意去受圣职；他既然不能获得那个<BR>
职位的俸禄，便希望我给他一些直接的经济利<BR>
益，不要以为他这个要求不合理。他又说，他<BR>
倒有意学法律，他叫我应该明白，要他靠一千<BR>
磅的利息去学法律，当然非常不够。我与其说<BR>
，相信他这些话靠得住，不如说，我但愿他这<BR>
些话靠得住。不过，我无论如何还是愿意答应<BR>
他的要求。我知道韦翰先生不适宜当牧师。因<BR>
此这件事立刻就谈委条件，获得解决：我们拿<BR>
出三千磅给他，他不再要求我们帮助他获得圣<BR>
职，算是自动放弃权利，即使将来他有资格担<BR>
任圣职，也不再提出请求。从此我和他之间的<BR>
一切关系，便好象一刀两断。我非常看不起他<BR>
，不再请他到彭伯里来玩，在城里也不和他来<BR>
往。我相信他大半都住在城里，但是他所谓学<BR>
法律，只不过是一个借口罢了，现在他既然摆<BR>
脱了一切羁绊，便整天过着浪荡挥霍的生活。<BR>
我大约接连三年简直听不到他的消息，可是后<BR>
来有个牧师逝世了，这份俸禄本来是可以由他<BR>
接替的，于是他又写信给我，要我荐举他。他<BR>
说他境遇窘得不能再窘，这一点我当然不难相<BR>
信。他又说研究法律毫无出息，现在已下决心<BR>
当牧师，只要我肯荐举他去接替这个位置就行<BR>
了。他自以为我一定会推荐他，因为他看准我<BR>
没有别人可以补缺，况且我也不能疏忽先父生<BR>
前应承他的一片好意。我没有答应他的要求，<BR>
他再三请求，我依然拒绝，这你总不见得会责<BR>
备我吧。他的境遇愈困苦，怨愤就愈深。毫无<BR>
问题，他无论在我背后骂我，当面骂我，都是<BR>
一样狠毒。从这个时期以后，连一点点面子账<BR>
的交情都完结了。我不知道他是怎样生活的，<BR>
可是说来痛心之至，去年夏天他又引起了我的<BR>
注意。我得在这里讲一件我自己也不愿意记起<BR>
的事。这件事我本来不愿意让任何人知道，可<BR>
是这一次却非得说一说不可。说到这里，我相<BR>
信你一定能保守秘密。我妹妹比我小十多岁，<BR>
由我母亲的内侄费茨威廉上校和我做她的保护<BR>
人。大约在一年以前，我们把她从学校里接回<BR>
来，把她安置在伦敦居住；去年夏天，她跟管<BR>
家的那位杨吉太太到拉姆斯盖特去了。韦翰先<BR>
生跟着也赶到那边去，显然是别有用意，因为<BR>
他和杨吉太太早就认识，我们很不幸上了她的<BR>
当，看错人了。仗着杨吉太太的纵容和帮忙，<BR>
他向乔治安娜求爱。可惜乔治安娜心肠太好，<BR>
还牢牢记着小时候他对待她的亲切，因此竟被<BR>
他打动了心，自以为爱上了他，答应跟他私奔<BR>
。她当时才十五岁，我们当然只能原谅她年幼<BR>
无知。她虽然糊涂胆大，可是总算幸亏她亲口<BR>
把这件事情告诉了我。原来在他们私奔之前，<BR>
我出乎意料地来到他们那里；乔治安娜一贯把<BR>
我这样一个哥哥当作父亲般看待，她不忍叫我<BR>
伤心受气，于是把这件事向我和和盘托出。你<BR>
可以想象得到，我当时是怎样的感触，又采取<BR>
了怎样的行动。为了顾全妹妹的名誉和情绪，<BR>
我没有把这件事公开揭露出来；可是我写了封<BR>
信给韦翰先生，叫他立刻离开那个地方，杨吉<BR>
太太当然也给打发走了。毫无问题，韦翰先生<BR>
主要是看中了我妹妹的三千磅财产，可是我也<BR>
不禁想到，他也很想借这个机会大大地报复我<BR>
一下。他差一点儿就报仇成了。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which
we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely
reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of
cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.  I know not in what manner, under
what form of falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success
is not, perhaps, to be wondered at.  Ignorant as you previously
were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be
in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last
night.  But I was not then master enough of myself to know what
could or ought to be revealed.  For the truth of every thing
here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony
of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and
constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my
father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every
particular of these transactions.  If your abhorrence of <I>me</I>
should make <I>my</I> assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there
may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to
find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in
the course of the morning.  I will only add, God bless you.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">小姐，我在这里已经把所有与我们有关的事，<BR>
都老老实实地谈过了；如果你并不完全认为我<BR>
撒谎，那么，我希望从今以后，你再也不要认<BR>
为我对韦翰先生残酷无情。我不知道他是用什<BR>
么样的胡说，什么样的手段来欺骗你的；不过<BR>
，你以前对于我们的事情一无所知，那么他骗<BR>
取了你的信任，也许不足为奇。你既无从探听<BR>
，又不喜欢怀疑。你也许不明白为什么我昨天<BR>
晚上不把这一切当面告诉你。可是当时我自己<BR>
也捉摸不住自己，不知道哪些话可以讲，哪些<BR>
话应该讲。这封信中所说的一切，是真是假，<BR>
我可以特别请你问问费茨威廉上校，他是我们<BR>
的近亲，又是我们的至交，而且是先父遗嘱执<BR>
行人之一，他对于其中的一切详情自然都十分<BR>
清楚，他可以来作证明。假使说，你因为厌恶<BR>
我，竟把我的话看得一文不值，你不妨把你的<BR>
意见说给我的表弟听；我所以要想尽办法找机<BR>
会把这封信一大早就交到你手里，就是为了让<BR>
你可以去和他商量一下。我要说的话都说完了<BR>
，愿上帝祝福你。<BR></TD>
