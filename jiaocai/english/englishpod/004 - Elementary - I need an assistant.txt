The Ofﬁce - I need an assistant!            (C0004)  A:    ...like I told you before, we just don’t have the re-        sources to hire you an assistant.  B:    I understand     that,   but  the  fact  is  we’re   under-        staffed.  A:   The timing is just not right.  The economy is bad,        and it’s too risky to take on new staff.  B:   Yeah, I guess you’re right....  here’s an idea, what        if we hire an intern?  She would take some of the       weight off my shoulders.  A:    She?  B:   Yeah,  you  know,  a  recent  graduate.          She  could       give me a hand with some of these projects and       we could keep our costs down.  A:    That sounds reasonable...  let me see what I can        do.  A:    Tony,  I’d like to introduce you to your new assis-        tant.  B:    OK, great! Let’s meet her!  C:    Hi, I’m Adam.  B:    Oh... hi... I’m Tony...
