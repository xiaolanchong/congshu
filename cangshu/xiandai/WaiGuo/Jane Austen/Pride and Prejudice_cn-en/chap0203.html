because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not
afraid of speaking openly.  Seriously, I would have you be on
your guard.  Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve
him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so
very imprudent.  I have nothing to say against <I>him</I>; he is a
most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought
to have, I should think you could not do better.  But as it is
-- you must not let your fancy run away with you.  You have
sense, and we all expect you to use it.  Your father would
depend on <I>your</I> resolution and good conduct, I am sure.  You

if he becomes really attached to me -- I believe it will be
better that he should not.  I see the imprudence of it. -- Oh!
<I>that</I> abominable Mr. Darcy! -- My father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honor; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.
My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.  In short, my
dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any
of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is
affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want
of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how
can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures
if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be
wisdom to resist?  All that I can promise you, therefore, is
not to be in a hurry.  I will not be in a hurry to believe
myself his first object.  When I am in company with him, I will
not be wishing.  In short, I will do my best."

我最大的荣幸，我要是辜负了他，一定会觉得<BR>

this week.  You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of
constant company for her friends.  But really, and upon my

I hope you are satisfied."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been
quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode
with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to
Mrs. Bennet.  His marriage was now fast approaching, and she
was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and
even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she
"<I>wished</I> they might be happy."  Thursday was to be the wedding
day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and
when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's
ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected
herself, accompanied her out of the room.  As they went down
stairs together, Charlotte said,

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for
Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or
to hear on the subject as usual.  Elizabeth soon heard from her
friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as
it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was
impossible.  Elizabeth could never address her without feeling
that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though
determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was.  Charlotte's first
letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there
could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her
new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she
would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters
were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on
every point exactly as she might have foreseen.  She wrote
cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned
nothing which she could not praise.  The house, furniture,
neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady
Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.  It was
Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally
softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her
own visit there, to know the rest.

Bingley.  "I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her
words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for
giving her no notice of my coming to London.  I was right,
therefore; my last letter had never reached her.  I enquired
after their brother, of course.  He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.  I
found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.  I wish I could
see her.  My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst
were going out.  I dare say I shall soon see them here."

endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but
she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and
inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did
at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive
herself no longer.  The letter which she wrote on this occasion
to her sister, will prove what she felt.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">四个星期过去了，吉英还没有见到彬格莱先生<BR>

她的态度也前后判若两人，吉英觉得再不能自<BR>

她妹妹，从这封信里可以看出她当时的心情：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing
in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to
have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.
But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do
not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what
her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your
suspicion.  I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing
to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to
happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.  Caroline
did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a
line, did I receive in the mean time.  When she did come, it
was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a
slight, formal, apology for not calling before, said not a word
of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered
a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to
continue the acquaintance no longer.  I pity, though I cannot
help blaming her.  She was very wrong in singling me out as she
did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
her side.  But I pity her, because she must feel that she has
been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for
her brother is the cause of it, I need not explain myself
farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless,
yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour
to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever
anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable.
I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears
now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met
long, long ago.  He knows of my being in town, I am certain,
from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her
manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he
is really partial to Miss Darcy.  I cannot understand it.  If I
were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted
to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all
this.  But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,
and think only of what will make me happy: your affection, and
the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.  Let me hear
from you very soon.  Miss Bingley said something of his never
returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
with any certainty.  We had better not mention it.  I am
extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our
friends at Hunsford.  Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
Maria.  I am sure you will be very comfortable there.

想想你的亲切以及亲爱的舅父母对我始终如一<BR>

说起他再也不会回到尼日斐花园来，说他打算<BR>
放弃那幢房子，可是说得并不怎么肯定。我们<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and
Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to
her aunt than to herself.  His apparent partiality had
subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some
one else.  Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she
could see it and write of it without material pain.  Her heart
had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that <I>she</I> would have been his only choice, had
fortune permitted it.  The sudden acquisition of ten thousand
pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom
he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less
clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not
quarrel with him for his wish of independence.  Nothing, on the
contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that
it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to
allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">大约就在这时候，嘉丁纳太太把上次伊丽莎白<BR>
答应过怎样对待韦翰的事，又向伊丽莎白提醒<BR>
了一下，并且问起最近的情况如何；伊丽莎白<BR>
回信上所说的话，虽然自己颇不满意，可是舅<BR>
母听了却很满意。原来他对她显著的好感已经<BR>
消失，他对她的殷勤也已经过去──他爱上了<BR>
别人了。伊丽莎白很留心地看出了这一切，可<BR>
是她虽然看出了这一切，在信上也写到这一切<BR>
，却并没有感到什么痛苦，她只不过稍许有些<BR>
感触。她想，如果她有些财产，早就成为他唯<BR>
一的意中人了──想到这里，她的虚荣心也就<BR>
得到了满足。拿他现在所倾倒的那位姑娘来说<BR>
，她的最显著的魅力就是使他可以获得一万金<BR>
镑的意外巨款；可是伊丽莎白对自己这件事，<BR>
也许不如上次对夏绿蒂的事那么看得清楚，因<BR>
此并没有因为他追求物质享受而怨怪他。她反<BR>
而以为这是再自然不过的事；她也想象到他遗<BR>
弃她一定颇费踌躇，可又觉得这对于双方都是<BR>
一种既聪明而又理想的办法，并且诚心诚意地<BR>
祝他幸福。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating
the circumstances, she thus went on: -- "I am now convinced, my
dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I
really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at
present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.
But my feelings are not only cordial towards <I>him</I>; they are
even impartial towards Miss King.  I cannot find out that I
hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.  There can be no love in all
this.  My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should
certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance,
were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I
regret my comparative insignificance.  Importance may sometimes
be purchased too dearly.  Kitty and Lydia take his defection
much more to heart than I do.  They are young in the ways of
the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as
the plain."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她把这一切都对嘉丁纳太太说了。叙述了这些<BR>
事以后，她接下去这样写道：“亲爱的舅母，<BR>
我现在深深相信，我根本没有怎样爱他，假如<BR>
我当真有了这种纯洁而崇高的感情，那我现在<BR>
一听到他的名字都会觉得讨厌，而且巴不得他<BR>
倒尽了霉。可是我情绪上不仅对他没有一些芥<BR>
蒂，甚至对金小姐也毫无成见。我根本不觉得<BR>
恨她，并且极其愿意把她看作一个很好的姑娘<BR>
。这桩事完全算不上恋爱。我的小心提防并不<BR>
是枉然的；要是我狂恋着他，亲友们就一定会<BR>
把我看作一个更有趣的话柄了，我决不因为人<BR>
家不十分器重我而竟会感到遗憾。太受人器重<BR>
有时候需要付出很大的代价。吉蒂和丽迪雅对<BR>
他的缺点计较得比我厉害。她们在人情世故方<BR>
面还幼稚得很，还不懂得这样一个有失体统的<BR>
信条：美少年和凡夫俗子一样，也得不饭吃，<BR>
有衣穿。”<BR></TD>
