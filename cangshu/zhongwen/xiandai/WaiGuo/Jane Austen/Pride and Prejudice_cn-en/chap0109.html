<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's
room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to
send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early
received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time
afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.  In spite of this amendment, however, she requested
to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit
Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.  The note
was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly
complied with.  Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest
girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白那一晚上的大部分时间都是在她姐姐<BR>
房间里度过的，第二天一大早，彬格莱先生就<BR>
派了个女佣人来问候她们。过了一会儿，彬格<BR>
莱的姐姐妹妹也打发了两个文雅的待女来探病<BR>
，伊丽莎白总算可以聊以自慰地告诉她们说，<BR>
病人已略见好转。不过，她虽然宽了一下心，<BR>
却还是要求他们府上替她差人送封信到浪博恩<BR>
去，要她的妈妈来看看吉英，来亲自判断她的<BR>
病情如何。信立刻就送去了，信上所说的事也<BR>
很快就照办了。班纳特太太带着两个最小的女<BR>
儿来到尼日斐花园的时候，他们家里刚刚吃过<BR>
早饭。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would
have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her,
that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her
recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would
probably remove her from Netherfield.  She would not listen
therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home;
neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time,
think it at all advisable.  After sitting a little while with
Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation the mother
and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast
parlour.  Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not
found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">倘使班纳特太太发觉吉英有什么危险，那她真<BR>
要伤心死了；但是一看到吉英的病并不怎么严<BR>
重，她就满意了；她也并不希望吉英马上复元<BR>
，因为，要是一复元，她就得离开尼日斐花园<BR>
回家去。所以她的女儿一提起要她带她回家去<BR>
，她听也不要听，况且那位差不多跟她同时来<BR>
到的医生，也认为搬回去不是个好办法。母亲<BR>
陪着吉英坐了一会儿工夫，彬格莱小姐便来请<BR>
她吃早饭，于是她就带着三个女儿一块儿上饭<BR>
厅去。彬格莱先生前来迎接她们，说是希望班<BR>
纳特太太看到了小姐的病一定会觉得并不是想<BR>
象中那般严重。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer.  "She is a great deal too

her.  We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太回答道：“我却没有想象到会这般<BR>

<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太连声道谢。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends
I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill
indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest
patience in the world -- which is always the way with her, for
she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met
with.  I often tell my other girls they are nothing to <I>her</I>.
You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming
prospect over that gravel walk.  I do not know a place in the
country that is equal to Netherfield.  You will not think of
quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short
lease."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">接着她又说道：“要不是靠好朋友们照顾，我<BR>
相信她真不知道变成什么样儿了；因为她实在<BR>
病得很重，，痛苦得很厉害，不过好在她有极<BR>
大的耐性──她一贯都是那样的，我生平简直<BR>
没见过第二个人有她这般温柔到极点的性格。<BR>
我常常跟别的几个女儿们说，她们比起她来简<BR>
直太差了。彬格莱先生，你这所房子很可爱呢<BR>
，从那条鹅卵石铺道上望出去，景致也很美丽<BR>
。在这个村庄里，我从来没见过一个地方比得<BR>
上尼日斐花园。虽然你的租期很短，我劝你千<BR>
万别急着搬走。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore
if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be
off in five minutes.  At present, however, I consider myself as
quite fixed here."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱先生说：“我随便干什么事，都是说干<BR>
就干，要是打定主意要离开尼日斐花园，我可<BR>
能在五分钟之内就搬走。不过目前我算在这儿<BR>
住定了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said
Elizabeth.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我猜想得一点儿不错，”伊丽莎白说。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning
towards her.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱马上转过身去对她大声说道：“你开始<BR>
了解我啦，是吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  yes -- I understand you perfectly.".
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢，是呀──我完全了解你。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily
seen through I am afraid is pitiful."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“但愿你这句话是恭维我，不过，这么容易被<BR>
人看透，那恐怕也是件可怜的事吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"That is as it happens.  It does not necessarily follow that a
deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a
one as yours."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那得看情况说话。一个深沉复杂的人，未必<BR>
比你这样的人更难叫人捉摸。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not
run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她有母亲连忙嚷道：“丽萃，别忘了你在作客<BR>
，家里让你撒野惯了，你可不能到人家这里来<BR>
胡闹。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately,
"that you were a studier of character.  It must be an amusing
study."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我以前倒不知道你是个研究人的性格的专家<BR>
。”彬格莱马上接下去说，“那一定是一门很<BR>
有趣的学问吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes; but intricate characters are the <I>most</I> amusing.  They
have at least that advantage."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不错；可是最有趣味的还是研究复杂的性格<BR>
。至少这样的性格有研究的价值。”达西说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few
subjects for such a study.  In a country neighbourhood you
move in a very confined and unvarying society."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“一般说来，乡下人可以作为这种研究对象的<BR>
就很少。因为在乡下，你四周围的人都是非常<BR>
不开通、非常单调。‘<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something
new to be observed in them for ever."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“可是人们本身的变动很多，他们身上永远有<BR>
新的东西值得你去注意。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of
mentioning a country neighbourhood.  "I assure you there is
quite as much of <I>that</I> going on in the country as in town."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太听到刚刚达西以那样一种口气提到<BR>
乡下，不禁颇为生气，便连忙嚷道：“这才说<BR>
得对呀，告诉你吧，乡下可供研究的对象并不<BR>
比城里少。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her
for a moment, turned silently away.  Mrs. Bennet, who fancied
she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her
triumph.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">大家都吃了一惊。达西朝她望了一会儿便静悄<BR>
悄地走开了。班纳特太太自以为完全占了他的<BR>
上风，便趁着一股兴头说下去：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the
country for my part, except the shops and public places.  The
country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我觉得伦敦除了店铺和公共场所以外，比起<BR>
乡下并没有什么大不了的好处。乡下可舒服得<BR>
多了──不是吗，彬格莱先生？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to
leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.
They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy
in either."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我到了乡下就不想走，”他回答道；“我住<BR>
到城里也就不想走。乡下和城里各有各的好处<BR>
，我随便住在哪儿都一样快乐。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Aye -- that is because you have the right disposition.  But
that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the
country was nothing at all."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“啊，那是因为你的性格好。可是那位先生，<BR>
”她说到这里，便朝达西望了一眼，“就会觉<BR>
得乡下一文不值。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for
her mother.  "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.  He only meant that
there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the
country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“妈妈，你根本弄错了，”伊丽莎白这话一出<BR>
口，她母亲就红了脸。“你完全弄错了达西先<BR>
生的意思。他只不过说，乡下碰不到象城里那<BR>
么些各色名样的人，这你可得承认是事实呀。<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not
meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there
are few neighbourhoods larger.  I know we dine with four and
twenty families."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“当然罗，宝贝──谁也没那么说过。要是说<BR>
这个村子里还碰不到多少人，我相信比这大的<BR>
村庄也就没有几个了。就我所知，平常跟我们<BR>
来往吃饭的可也有二十四家呀。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley
to keep his countenance.  His sister was less delicate, and
directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive
smile.  Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might
turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas
had been at Longbourn since <I>her</I> coming away.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">要不是顾全伊丽莎白的面子，彬格莱先生简直<BR>
忍不住要笑出来了。他的妹妹可没有他那么用<BR>
心周到，便不由得带着富有表情的笑容望着达<BR>
西先生。伊丽莎为了找个借口转移一下她母亲<BR>
的心思，便问她母亲说，自从她离家以后，夏<BR>
绿蒂・卢卡斯有没有到浪博恩来过。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.  What an agreeable
man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley -- is not he?  so much the man
of fashion!  so genteel and so easy! -- He has always something
to say to every body. -- <I>That</I> is my idea of good breeding;
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never
open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“来过；她是昨儿跟他父亲一块儿来的。威廉<BR>
爵士是个多么和蔼的人呀，彬格莱先生──他<BR>
可不是吗？那么时髦的一个人！那么温雅，又<BR>
那么随便！他见到什么人总要谈上儿句。这就<BR>
是我所谓的有良好教养；那些自以为了不起、<BR>
金口难开的人，他们的想法真是大错而特错。<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Did Charlotte dine with you?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“夏绿蒂在我们家里吃饭的吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"No, she would go home.  I fancy she was wanted about the mince
pies.  For my part, Mr. Bingley, <I>I</I> always keep servants that
can do their own work; <I>my</I> daughters are brought up
differently.  But every body is to judge for themselves, and
the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you.  It is a
pity they are not handsome!  Not that <I>I</I> think Charlotte so
<I>very</I> plain -- but then she is our particular friend."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“没有，她硬要回去。据我猜想，大概是她家<BR>
里街头等着她回去做肉饼。彬格莱先生，我雇<BR>
起佣人来，总得要她们能够料理份内的事，我<BR>
的女儿就不是旬人家那样教养大的。可是一切<BR>
要看各人自己，告诉你，卢卡斯家里的几个姑<BR>
娘全是些很好的女孩子。只可惜长得不漂亮！<BR>
当然并不是我个人以为夏绿蒂长得难看，她究<BR>
竟是我们要好的朋友。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“她看来是位很可爱的姑娘，”彬格莱说。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  dear, yes; -- but you must own she is very plain.  Lady
Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.
I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane --
one does not often see any body better looking.  It is what
every body says.  I do not trust my own partiality.  When she
was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother
Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we
came away.  But however he did not.  Perhaps he thought her too
young.  However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty
they were."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“是呀，可是你得承认，她的确长得很难看。<BR>
卢卡斯太太本人也那么说，她还羡慕我的吉英<BR>
长得漂亮呢。我并不喜欢夸张自己的孩子，可<BR>
是说老实话。这并不是我说话有信心。还在她<BR>
十五岁的那一年，在我城里那位兄弟嘉丁纳家<BR>
里，有位先生就爱上了她，我的弟妇看准了那<BR>
位先生一定会在临走以前向她求婚。不过后来<BR>
他却没有提。也许是他以为她年纪太小了吧。<BR>
不过他却为吉英写了好些诗，而且写得很好。<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving
away love!"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那位先生的一场恋爱就这么结束了，”伊丽<BR>
莎白不耐烦地说。“我想，多少有情人都是这<BR>
样把自己克服过来的。诗居然有这种功能──<BR>
能够赶走爱情，这倒不知道是谁第一个发现的<BR>
！”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I have been used to consider poetry as the <I>food</I> of love,"
said Darcy.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我却一贯认为，诗是爱情的食粮，”达西说<BR>
。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.  Every thing nourishes
what is strong already.  But if it be only a slight, thin sort
of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve
it entirely away."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那必须是一种优美、坚贞、健康的爱情才行<BR>
。本身健强了，吃什么东西都可以获得滋补。<BR>
要是只不过有一点儿蛛丝马迹，那么我相信，<BR>
一首十四行诗准会把它断送掉。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Darcy only smiled, and the general pause which ensued made
Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself
again.  She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;
and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her
thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane with an apology
for troubling him also with Lizzy.  Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister
to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.  She
performed her part, indeed, without much graciousness, but
Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her
carriage.  Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put
herself forward.  The two girls had been whispering to each
other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that
the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his
first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西只笑了一下，接着大伙儿都沉默了一阵子<BR>
，这时候伊丽莎白很是着急，怕她母亲又要出<BR>
丑。她想说点儿什么，可是又想不出什么可说<BR>
的。沉默了一下以后，班纳特太太又重新向彬<BR>
格莱先生道谢，说是多亏他对吉英照顾周到，<BR>
同时又向他道歉说，丽萃也来打扰了他。彬格<BR>
莱先生回答得极其恳切而有礼貌，弄得他的妹<BR>
妹也不得不讲礼貌，说了些很得体的话她说话<BR>
的态度并不十分自然，可是班纳特太太已经够<BR>
满意的了。一会儿工夫，班纳特太太就叫预备<BR>
马车。这个号令一发，她那位顶小的女儿立刻<BR>
走上前来。原来自从她们母女来到此地，两个<BR>
女儿就一直在交头接耳地商量，最后说定了由<BR>
顶小的女儿来要求彬格莱先生兑现他刚以乡下<BR>
时的诺言，在尼日斐花园开一次跳舞会。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine
complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her
mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early
age.  She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural
self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom
her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended
her, had increased into assurance.  She was very equal,
therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball,
and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would
be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their
mother's ear.
