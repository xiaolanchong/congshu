<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a
question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she
entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down
to table.  She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered
about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.  She coloured as
she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a
suspicion of the truth.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">且说伊丽莎白一走进家门，吉英便问她：“亲<BR>
爱的丽萃，你们到什么地方去了？”等到他们<BR>
俩人坐下来的时候，家里所有的人都这样问她<BR>
，她只得说，他们俩人随便逛逛，后来她自己<BR>
也不知道走到什么地方去了。她说话时涨红了<BR>
脸；可是不管她神色如何，都没有引起大家怀<BR>
疑到那件事上面去。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing
extraordinary.  The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the
unacknowledged were silent.  Darcy was not of a disposition in
which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and
confused, rather <I>knew</I> that she was happy than <I>felt</I> herself
to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were
other evils before her.  She anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that
no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others
it was a <I>dislike</I> which not all his fortune and consequence
might do away.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">那个下午平平静静地过去了，并没有什么特别<BR>
的事情。公开的那一对爱人有说有笑；没有公<BR>
开的那一对不声不响。达西生性沉静，喜悦不<BR>
形于色；伊丽莎白心慌意乱，只知道自己很幸<BR>
福，却没有确切体味到究竟如何幸福，因为除<BR>
了眼前这一阵别扭以外，还有种种麻烦等在前<BR>
头。她预料事情公开以后，家里人有何各感觉<BR>
。她知道除了吉英以外，家里没有一个人喜欢<BR>
他，她甚至顾虑到家里人都会讨厌他，哪怕凭<BR>
他的财产地位，也是无法挽救。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">At night she opened her heart to Jane.  Though suspicion was
very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely
incredulous here.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">晚上，她把真心话说给吉英听。虽说吉英一向<BR>
并不多疑，可是对这件事却简直不肯相信。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You are joking, Lizzy.  This cannot be! -- engaged to
Mr. Darcy!  No, no, you shall not deceive me.  I know it
to be impossible."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你在开玩笑！丽萃。不会有这种事！跟达西<BR>
先生订婚！不行，不行，你不要骗我；我知道<BR>
这件事不可能。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"This is a wretched beginning indeed!  My sole dependence was
on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do
not.  Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.  I speak nothing but the
truth.  He still loves me, and we are engaged."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“一开头就这样糟糕，可真要命！我唯一希望<BR>
全寄托在你身上，要是你不相信我，就没有人<BR>
会相信我了。我决不是跟你胡说。我说的都是<BR>
真话。他仍然爱我，我们已经讲定了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Jane looked at her doubtingly.  "Oh, Lizzy!  it cannot be.
I know how much you dislike him."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英半信半疑地看着她。“噢，丽萃，不会不<BR>
这种事的。我知道你非常厌恶他。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You know nothing of the matter.  <I>That</I> is all to be forgot.
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.  But in
such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.  This is
the last time I shall ever remember it myself."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你一点也不明白这里面的曲折，这种话不必<BR>
再提。也许我一向并不象现在这样爱他。可是<BR>
这一类的事，总不应该把宿怨记得太牢。我从<BR>
今以后也一定要把它忘记得干干净净。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.  Elizabeth again, and
more seriously assured her of its truth.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特小姐仍然显出非常诧异的样子。于是伊<BR>
丽莎白更加一本正经地重新跟她说，这是事实<BR>
。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Good Heaven!  can it be really so!  Yet now I must believe
you," cried Jane.  "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would -- I do
congratulate you -- but are you certain?  forgive the question
-- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英不禁大声叫道：“老天爷呀！真有这件事<BR>
吗？这一下我可应该相信你了，我的好丽萃，<BR>
亲丽萃，我要恭喜你，我一定得恭喜你；可是<BR>
，对不起，让我问你一声：你能不能断定──<BR>
能不能百分之百地断定，嫁了他是否幸福？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"There can be no doubt of that.  It is settled between us
already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.
But are you pleased, Jane?  Shall you like to have such a
brother?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这当然毫无疑问。我们俩都认为我们是世界<BR>
上最幸福的一对。可是你高兴吗，吉英？你愿<BR>
意要这样一位妹夫吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Very, very much.  Nothing could give either Bingley or
myself more delight.  But we considered it, we talked of it as
impossible.  And do you really love him quite well enough?
Oh, Lizzy!  do any thing rather than marry without affection.
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“非常非常愿意。彬格莱和我真是再高兴也没<BR>
有了。这件事我们也考虑赤，谈论过，都认为<BR>
不可能。你当真非常爱他吗？噢，丽萃，什么<BR>
事都可以随便，没有爱情可千万不能结婚。你<BR>
确实感觉到你应该这样做吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh, yes!  You will only think I feel <I>more</I> than I ought to
do, when I tell you all."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“的确如此！等我把详情细节都告诉了你，你<BR>
只会觉得我还做得不够呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"What do you mean?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你这话是什么意思？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.
I am afraid you will be angry."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“嗳，我得承认，我爱他要比爱彬格莱更深切<BR>
。我怕你要生气吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My dearest sister, now <I>be</I> serious.  I want to talk very
seriously.  Let me know every thing that I am to know, without
delay.  Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“好妹妹，请你严肃一些。我要听你严肃地谈<BR>
一谈。凡是可以对我说的话，赶快对我说个明<BR>
白，你是否愿意告诉我，你爱他有多久了？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it
began.  But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his
beautiful grounds at Pemberley."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这是慢慢儿发展起来的，我也说不出从什么<BR>
时候开始，不过我觉得，应该人看到彭伯里他<BR>
那美丽的花园算起。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced
the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn
assurances of attachment.  When convinced on that article, Miss
Bennet had nothing farther to wish.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">姐姐又叫她严肃些，这一次总算产生了效果；<BR>
她立刻依了吉英的意见，郑重其事地把自己受<BR>
他的经过讲给吉英听。班纳特小姐弄明白了这<BR>
一点以后，便万事放心了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as
myself.  I always had a value for him.  Were it for nothing but
his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as
Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley
and yourself more dear to me.  But Lizzy, you have been very
sly, very reserved with me.  How little did you tell me of what
passed at Pemberley and Lambton!  I owe all that I know of it
to another, not to you."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她说：“我现在真是太幸福了，因为你也会同<BR>
我一样幸福。我一向很器重他。不说别的，光<BR>
是为了他爱你，我也就要永远敬重他了；他既<BR>
是彬格莱的朋友，现在又成了你的丈夫，那么<BR>
除了彬格莱和你以外，我最喜欢的当然就是他<BR>
啦。可是丽萃，你太狡猾了，平常连一点口风<BR>
也不向我吐露。彭伯里的事和蓝白屯的事从来<BR>
没有说给我听过！我所知道的一些情形，都是<BR>
别人说给我听的，不是你自己说的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.  She had been
unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her
own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.
But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in
Lydia's marriage.  All was acknowledged, and half the night
spent in conversation.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白只得把保守秘密的原因告诉了她。原<BR>
来她以前不愿意提起彬格莱，加上她又心绪不<BR>
宁，所以也不讲起达西，可是现在，她大可不<BR>
必再把达西为丽迪雅婚姻奔忙的那段情节，瞒<BR>
住吉英了。她把一切事都和盘托出，姐妹俩一<BR>
直谈到半夜。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window
the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming
here again with our dear Bingley!  What can he mean by being so
tiresome as to be always coming here?  I had no notion but he
would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us
with his company.  What shall we do with him?  Lizzy, you must
walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">第二天早上，班纳特太太站在窗口叫道：“天<BR>
哪！那位讨厌的达西先生又跟着我们的彬格莱<BR>
一块儿上这儿来了！他为什么那样不知趣，老<BR>
是要上这儿来？我但愿他去找鸟，或者随便去<BR>
干点什么，可别来吵我们。叫我们拿他怎么办<BR>
？丽萃，你又得同他出去散散步才也，不要让<BR>
他在这里麻烦彬格莱。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a
proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be
always giving him such an epithet.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">母亲想出这个办法来，正是伊丽莎白求之不得<BR>
的，她禁不住要笑出来，可是听到母亲老是说<BR>
他讨厌，她亦不免有些气恼。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,
and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good
information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mrs. Bennet,
have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her
way again to-day?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">两位贵客一走进门，彬格莱便意味深长地望着<BR>
她，热烈地跟她的握手，她一看见这情形，便<BR>
断定他准是消息十分灵通；不多一会儿工夫，<BR>
他果然大声说道：“班纳特太太，这一带还有<BR>
什么别的曲径小道，可以让丽萃今天再去迷路<BR>
吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet,
"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.  It is a nice long walk,
and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太说：“我要劝达西先生、丽萃和吉<BR>
蒂，今天上午都上奥克汉山去。这一段长路走<BR>
起来挺有味，达西先生还没有见过那儿的风景<BR>
呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but
I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.  Won't it, Kitty?"
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.  Darcy professed
a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth
silently consented.  As she went up stairs to get ready,
Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱先生说：“对他们两人当然再好也没有<BR>
了，我看吉蒂一定吃不消。是不是，吉蒂？”<BR>
吉蒂说她宁可待在家里。达西表示非常想到那<BR>
座山上去看看四面的风景。伊丽莎白默默表示<BR>
同意，正要上楼去准备，班纳特太太在她后面<BR>
说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have
that disagreeable man all to yourself.  But I hope you will not
mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no
occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.  So, do
not put yourself to inconvenience."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“丽萃，我很对不起你，逼你去跟那个讨厌的<BR>
人在一起，你可不要计较。你要知道，这都是<BR>
为了吉英；你只消随便敷衍敷衍他，不必多费<BR>
心思。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent
should be asked in the course of the evening.  Elizabeth
reserved to herself the application for her mother's.  She
could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes
doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough
to overcome her abhorrence of the man.  But whether she were
violently set against the match, or violently delighted with
it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted
to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that
Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the
first vehemence of her disapprobation.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">散步的时候，两人决定当天下午就去请求班纳<BR>
特先生表示允许；母亲那儿由伊丽莎白自己去<BR>
说。她不知道母亲是否会赞成。母亲实在太厌<BR>
恶他了，因此伊丽莎白有时候竟会认为，即使<BR>
以他财产地位，也挽回不了母亲的心，可是，<BR>
母亲对这门婚姻无论是坚决反对也好，欣喜若<BR>
狂也好，她的出言吐语反正都是不得体。叫人<BR>
家觉得她毫无见识。她对达西先生不是欣喜欲<BR>
狂地表示赞成，便是义愤填胸地表示反对，伊<BR>
丽莎白想到这里，心里实在受不了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,
she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation
on seeing it was extreme.  She did not fear her father's
opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it
should be through her means -- that <I>she</I>, his favourite child,
should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him
with fears and regrets in disposing of her -- was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared
again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his
smile.  In a few minutes he approached the table where she was
sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work
said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the
library."  She was gone directly.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">当天下午，只见班纳特先生刚一走进书房，达<BR>
西先生便立刻站起身来跟着他走，伊丽莎白看<BR>
到这情形，心里焦急到了极点。她并不是怕父<BR>
亲反对，而是怕父亲会给弄得不愉快。她想，<BR>
她是父亲最宠爱的女儿，如果她选择了这个对<BR>
象，竟会使父亲感到痛苦，使父亲为她终身大<BR>
事忧虑惋惜，未免太不象话。她担心地坐在那<BR>
儿，直到达西先生回到她身边，面带笑意，她<BR>
这才松了口气。一会儿工夫，达西走到她跟吉<BR>
蒂一块儿坐着的那张桌子跟前来，装做欣赏她<BR>
手里的针线，轻声地跟她说：“快到你爸爸那<BR>
儿去，他在书房里等着你。”她马上就去了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and
anxious.  "Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?  Are you out
of your senses, to be accepting this man?  Have not you always
hated him?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她父亲正在房间里踱来踱去，看他那种神气，<BR>
既是严肃，又是焦急。他说：“丽萃，你在闹<BR>
些什么？你疯了吗，你怎么会要这个人？你不<BR>
是一向都恨他吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had
been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!  It would
have spared her from explanations and professions which it was
exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and
she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to
Mr. Darcy.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她这时候真是焦急非凡。假若她从前不是那样<BR>
见解过火，出言不逊，那就好了，那现在用不<BR>
到那么尴尴尬尬地去解释和剖白了。可是事到<BR>
如今，既是免不了要费些唇舌，她只得心慌意<BR>
乱地跟父亲说，她爱上了达西先生。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.  He is
rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine
carriages than Jane.  But will they make you happy?"

belief of my indifference?"

pain me by speaking of him in such terms."

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent.
He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare
refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.  I now give it
to <I>you</I>, if you are resolved on having him.  But let me advise
you to think better of it.  I know your disposition, Lizzy.
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless
you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him
as a superior.  Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage.  You could scarcely
escape discredit and misery.  My child, let me not have the
grief of seeing <I>you</I> unable to respect your partner in life.
You know not what you are about."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">父亲说：“丽萃，我已经允许他了。象他那样<BR>

了解你的个性，丽萃。我知道，你除非真正能<BR>
敬重你的丈夫，认为他高你一等，你便不会觉<BR>
得幸福，也不会觉得得意。以你这样了不起的<BR>
才能，要是婚姻攀得不相称，那是极其危险的<BR>

子，别让我以后眼看着你瞧不起你的终身伴侣<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her
reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was
really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual
change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her
absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a
day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and
enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer
her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白更加感动，便非常认真、非常严肃地<BR>
回答他的话；后来她又几次三番地说，达西确<BR>
实确实是她选中的对象，说她对他的敬爱已经<BR>
步步提高，说她相信他的感情决不是一朝一夕<BR>
生长起来的，而是搁置了好几个和考验出来的<BR>
；她又竭力赞扬他种种优美的品质，这才打消<BR>
了父亲的犹疑，完全赞成了这门婚姻。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no

Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and <I>would</I> have paid

reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some

and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room,
she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.
Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed
tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to

come in time.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she
followed her, and made the important communication.  Its effect
was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet
sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.  Nor was it
under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she
heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for
the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them.  She began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder,
and bless herself.

in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference
for his opinion.
