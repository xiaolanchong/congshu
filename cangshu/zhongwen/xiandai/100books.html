<h2>1. 呐喊 鲁迅</h2>
<div>Lu Xun, Call to Arms (Nahan), 1923 <span>✓<span></div>
<p>
First Lu Xun's short story collection. Lu Xun (1881–1936, real name Zhou Shuren), the author of “The Diary of a
Madman,”was later hailed as the founding father of modernChinese literature
and the conscience of China. A native of Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, Lu
Xun had an unhappy childhood, owing to his father’s untimely death from
tuberculosis, and to his grandfather’s imprisonment under a charge of taking
a bribe at a civil service examination. In 1902, he was awarded an official grant
to study medicine in Japan, but changed his career plans in 1906, allegedly
as the result of seeing a slide show that contained a famous scene in which
a Chinese crowd idly watches as one of their compatriots is beheaded by
Japanese soldiers for serving as a spy for the Russian army during the RussoJapanese war (1904–1905). Dumbfounded, Lu Xun realized that, before saving
people’s bodies, he had first to save their souls; hence, before practicing
ordinary medicine, he must first cure the spirit of China, using the medicine
of literature.
</p>

<p>
The May 1918 issue of New Youth carried a short story of less than five thousand
words entitled “The Diary of a Madman” (Kuangren riji). The story features
the diary entries of a Madman who believes that he lives in a society of
cannibals. At the climax of his diary, the Madman hopes there may still be
children who have not eaten human flesh and cries, “Save the children!” This
is framed by a context in which the Madman is said to be cured and to have
rejoined the society he formerly condemned.
</p>
<p>
He may have drawn inspiration from
Gogol’s “The Diary of a Madman” and other foreign sources. Equally
remarkable, however, is that this Madman may bear a Chinese genealogy
traceable to the melancholy poet Qu Yuan of “Encountering Sorrow,” the
eccentric hermits of the Zhuangzi, and the wayward free spirits of the Six
Dynasties. But, for May Fourth readers, the Madman embodied a man with forbidden knowledge. Behind the fac¸ade of Confucianism lay an orgiastic
ritual of barbarism.
</p>
<p>
After the success of “The Diary of a Madman,” Lu Xun went on to write a
series of short stories. The True Story of AhQ (AhQ zhengzhuan) depicts in mockheroicstyle asmall-timehooliganthrivingonthe “methodofspiritual victory”:
bullying the weak and cowering before the strong.
</p>
<p>
In his “homecoming”
stories, such as “My Old Home” (Guxiang), “New Year’s Sacrifice” (Zhufu),
and “In the Tavern” (Zai jiulou shang), he writes about the painful encounter
between the inarticulate peasant and the guilt-ridden intellectual, and the
“invisible wall” that makes all attempts at communication futile.
</p>

<p>
“Kong Yiji” (Kong Yiji) and “White Light” (Baiguang) both portray traditional literati trapped in a changing time.
</p>

<p>
In “Divorce” (Lihun) and “A Small Matter” (Yijian xiaoshi), Lu Xun caricatures human frailties and grotesqueries. These
stories were later included in two collections, Call to Arms (Nahan, 1923) and
Wandering (Panghuang, 1926).
</p>

<p>
Lu Xun’s modernist sensibility can be best appreciated in his ambivalent interaction with tradition. His project to reform the Chinese mind
demonstrates a case of what Yu-sheng Lin calls the “cultural, intellectual- ¨
istic approach” to problems, by which he means the prevalent conviction that
China’s problems stem solely from the break in cultural and intellectual coherence and can be solved only in immanent, holistic terms. To be sure, Lu Xun
sets out to take issue with such an approach; for him, the sanctioned Chinese
civilization has long been lost, or, worse, it never existed except as a pretext
for a highly developed cannibalism. But, granted his vehement satiric intent,
he betrays time and again both a longing to regain a coherent form of meaning
and a skepticism about this longing. Out of his desire to “transform the spirit”
of the Chinese people and his subsequent disavowal of the possibility of doing
this emerges the basic dilemma of his search for modernity.
</p>

<p>
However eloquent his inquiry into the Chinese national character, there
is one dimension Lu Xun remained reticent about, namely the romantic and
erotic dynamic in May Fourth subjectivity. He was, of course, not unaware of
the consequences of repressed and oppressed sexuality in traditional society.
He himselfwas the victim of an arranged marriage. Although, out ofregard for
his mother, he never divorced his wife, Lu Xun lived in celibacy for years until
his affair with his student Xu Guangping (1898–1968). In his essays and letters,
Lu Xun attacked conventional sexual mores violently. Essays like “What
Happened after Nora’s Departure” (Nala zouhou zenyang, 1923) and “On
the Collapse of the Leifeng Tower” (Lun Leifeng ta de daodiao, 1924) stress
compellingly the social and ethical need to remold Chinese womanhood.
In his fictional writings, however, Lu Xun rarely touches on eroticism and
sexuality.
</p>

<p>
He employs multiple strategies in depicting
the real: comic caricature (“Kong Yiji”), mock heroic (The True Story of Ah Q),
sardonic interlude (“Divorce”), lyrical rendition (“My Old Home”), allegory
(“Medicine”), and so on. Underlying all these writings, however, is a theory
that emphasizes the representational link between mind and body, language
and reality. But Lu Xun’s longing for a fully fledged representation of the
real ironically nurtures itself on the “break” in this chain of referentiality, as
emphatically symbolized by a beheaded body, a split personality (“The Diary
of A Madman,” “New Year’s Sacrifice”), or a living corpse (“In the Tavern”).
It is awareness of this break that fuels Lu Xun’s nostalgia for the semantic
and somatic plenitude of Chinese reality and the polemical power of his
writing.
</p>

<h2>2. 边城	沈从文</h2>
<div>Shen Congwen, Border Town (Biancheng), 1934 <span>✓<span></div>
<p>
Shen Congwen’s writing engendered not merely simple nostalgia
but an imaginary nostalgia, a self-reflexive display of nostalgia as the fantastic
inscription of a hometown and of the memory of a past that is always already
mediated. His Border Town (Biancheng, 1934), perhaps the most popular piece
of native-soil of twentieth-century China, is a pastoral about a young girl’s
involvement with two boatman brothers against the ethereal backdrop of
western Hunan scenery; this romance is nevertheless jeopardized by dark
family memories, unhappy coincidences, and misunderstandings. The novella
projects as much Shen’s longing for his hometown at its most romantic as
it does his awareness of the contingency and unreality of that longing when
thrown into the flux of time and history.
</p>

<h2>3. 骆驼祥子 老舍</h2>
<div>Lao She, Camel Xiangzi, 1937 <span>✓<span></div>
<p>
Lao She’s Camel Xiangzi, which ends with the narrator’s cynical condemnation of the once hardworking rickshaw puller as a “degenerate, selfish,
unfortunate offspring of an ailing society,” was completed in 1937, its strident note signaling the changing ethos among even humanitarian writers.
</p>


<h2>4 传奇 张爱玲</h2>

<p>Eileen Chang (Zhang Ailing) </p>


<h2>5 围城 钱钟书</h2>
<div>Qian ZhongShu, Besieged Town, 1947 <span>✓<span></div>
<p>
The title of Qian Zhongshu’s novel Fortress Besieged (Wei cheng) is a
metaphor for the predicament of marriage: “People outside the fortress want
to get in and people inside want to get out.” In matters of the heart, the protagonist Fang Hongjian always lands in an undesirable situation from which
he cannot extricate himself. Although he is basically a good person, his relationships with his family, colleagues, and wife deteriorate over time because
he is too shy to express his true feelings and too weak to take a stand. Against
the backdrop of banal life, he becomes isolated and impotent. Fang’s peregrinations from Shanghai to the country’s interior and back suggest that another
dimension of “fortress besieged” is that of going in circles. At the existential
level, this dark picaresque novel is a commentary on the trapped condition of
the modern man.
</p>

<p>
Fortress Besieged is a satire that spares no character, not even the children.
The author uses figurative images extensively and turns familiar aphorisms
into original analogies. For example, a scantily clad Miss Bao is referred to as
“partial truth” since truth is supposed to be “naked.” Qian’s wit also manifests
itself in puns. Courtship is described this way: “If an engagement ring is a lasso
that catches him, a button is a pin that nails him.” Fortress Besieged was first
serialized in Literary Renaissance from 1944 to 1946 before it was published in
book form in 1947; it went through three editions in two years. Unavailable
in Maoist China, the novel made a comeback in the 1980s and was made into
a television series in 1990.
</p>

<h2>6	子夜 	茅盾</h2>
<div>Mao Dun, Midnight (Ziye), 1933 <span>✓<span></div>
<p>
Midnight (Ziye, 1933) represents the climax of Mao Dun’s novelistic engagement before the Second Sino-Japanese War. A novel of epic scope, its central
theme concerns the futile struggle of a group of Chinese capitalists to establish viable industries in competition with foreign economic powers and their
involvement in a ferocious native game of stock market speculation. Mao Dun intends to make the world of Midnight the dark period before the dawn of
revolution. He invests the novel with mythical capital that is the unexpected
dividend of the entropic world of speculation and fictitious dealings. The capitalist world of Shanghai will fall, only to beget a new paradise. Speculation,
therefore, in its extended sense, is not only a formidable force precipitating
the fall of the world, but also part of the grand dialectic of history giving rise
to the return of order.
</p>
<p>
Underlying this plotline is a parodic review of the concept of revolutionand-romance. Not only do men and women in Shanghai’s high society gamble
on the stock market; they even take romantic love as a kind of currency. They
fall in and out of love as if betting on the value of each romance. At Mao
Dun’s most polemical, he portrays even Communists as speculators in both
personal and public spheres. Under the Li Lisan Line, a Party line calling for
urban proletariat organization and violent action, these revolutionaries are
seen as misinvesting their passion and action at a time least favorable to their
agenda, so that their efforts are doomed from the beginning. As the first part
of a grand plan that was never carried out, Midnight concludes with an open
ending, leaving us uncertain as to the outcome of revolution
</p>

<h2>7	台北人 	白先勇</h2>

<div>Bai Xianyong (Pai Hsian Yong), Taipei People (Taibei ren), 1965 <span>✓<span></div>

<p>
 In 1965 he started writing stories that would be collectively
known as Taipei People (Taibei ren). In the opening story, “The Eternal Snow
Beauty” (Yongyuan de Yin Xueyan), Snow Beauty is a scandalous socialite
from Shanghai who uncannily never ages. Throwing mahjong parties for
recent mainland emigr ´ es, she is the perfect hostess, re-creating the elegance ´
and opulence of Old Shanghai down to the last detail. Her home in Taipei
provides a cozy haven for those men and women who have lost everything:
wealth and power, youth and beauty. Like a goddess watching mortals play
their petty games, Snow Beauty is emotionally detached and subtly condescending to her “guests,” whose generous tips support her lifestyle. Her
“coldness” is demonstrated by her affair with a middle-aged businessman, who is stabbed to death by a disgruntled employee. The evening after his
funeral, at which she puts in a brief appearance, she hosts a mahjong game at
her house; all is business as usual.
</p>

<h2>8	家 	巴金</h2>
<div>Ba Jin, Family(Jia), 1933 <span>✓<span></div>


<p>
Ba Jin (1904–2005) brought the romantic sentiment in revolutionary fiction
into full bloom. An anarchist from Sichuan, he wanted to write as a way of
professing his conviction of love, equality, and solidarity in humankind, while
acknowledging the violent undercurrent of his agenda. In early works such
as Love Trilogy (Aiqing sanbuqu, 1928), revolutionaries martyr themselves as if
dying for love unrequited. It is Family( Jia), PartOne of theTorrentTrilogy( Jiliu
sanbuqu), that consummates all the elements of the revolution-and-romance
formula. Published in 1933, Family is a saga about the Gao family of Sichuan
during the May Fourth era, focusing on three Gao brothers in their battle
against the feudal family system, their pursuit of love, and their consequent
choices of either reconciliation or a total break with the family.
<p>
</p>
Family was an instant hit among readers, and in the next decades it was
to become a celebrated primer for all who were yearning for revolutionary
zeal and romantic passion. Compared with his peers, Ba Jin at this stage
of his career is not a crafted writer; his narrative is flooded with unbridled
passion, melodramatic plotting, and tendentious outcries. His “phenomenon”
is not merely a matter of literary taste but a testimony to the shared need of
one generation of readers to encode their emotional and ideological outputs.
Indeed, Ba Jin embodies in both his works and his own image the symbolism
of “youthful China” as envisioned by Liang Qichao and the May Fourth
forerunners. A novel like Family, therefore, is realistic in the sense that it is not
only a reflection of the cannibalistic nature of feudal society but also a timely
engagement with the call for articulating the real – justice, love, revolution,
and so on – in a strongly dramatic format.
</p>

<h2>9	呼兰河传 	萧红</h2>
<div>Xiao Hong, Tales of Hulan river, 1942 <span>✓<span></div>
<p>
One of the most important works published in wartime Hong Kong came
from Xiao Hong (1911–1942). In 1938, she had broken up with her first husband
Xiao Jun (1907–1988) and married Duanmu Hongliang. The couple arrived in
Hong Kong in January 1940 and lived at No. 8 Locke (Ledao) Road in Tsimshasui ( Jianshazui), Kowloon. Here she wrote the autobiographical sketches that
comprised Tales of Hulan River (Hulan he zhuan), the satire Ma Bole, and other
pieces.
</p>
<p>
Tales of Hulan River, about life in a Manchurian village, is told by a child
from a landlord family and portrays the suffering of men and women as a
result of superstition and blind conformity to tradition. The bleakness of this
world is alleviated only by the joy of the child spending time with her kind
and wise grandfather, who teaches her how to read and how to live.
</p>

<h2>10	老残游记 刘鹗</h2>

<p>
Liu E’s The Travels of Lao Can (1906) is one of the most popular novels of
the late Qing. Lao Can is a doctor by profession and by avocation a chivalric
knight, an enlightened intellectual and a conservative ideologue.Through Lao
Can’s lonely adventures across natural and human landscapes, as he wanders
among different social milieux and engages his friends in debates on political
and philosophical issues, the author presents a panorama of late Qing society
at the moment before its total disintegration. The Travels of Lao Can has been
read variously as a great novel of expose, an intricate allegorical narrative, a 
unique Chinese picaresque novel, a lyrical novel, and a political novel.
<p>
</p>
Not unlike his hero, Liu E led a life full of contradictions, being both a
self-styled entrepreneur and a conservative scholar, both a connoisseur of
ancient curios and a comprador for foreign investors. Fiction writing was
never his primary activity, yet The Travels of Lao Can places him among
the most sensitive literary minds of his time, one who can capture the full
spectrum of resentments, frustrations, dreams, and fantasies of a generation
of Chinese intellectuals in the face of national crisis.
<p>
</p>
The Travels of Lao Can has often been cited as a rare example of the late Qing
writer’s ability to deal with a character’s psychology. Lao Can’s sorrow at his
country’s fate, his indignation at innocent suffering, and his lyrical fascination
with natural subjects all show a sensitive soul’s response to external stimuli.
But the novel is at its most powerful when it describes the hero’s frustration
and amazement as he tries in vain to penetrate beyond the treacherous surface
of a givensituation.Why arethe incorruptible judges more dangerousthanthe
corruptible ones? Why do Chinese people persecute those who can provide
the most ready cures for the country’s diseases? Such questions function as
leitmotifs recurring throughout the novel. They drive the narrator (and the
reader) again and again out of Lao Can’s inner world to refocus on the outer
problems that make Lao Can what he is
</p>

<h2>11	寒夜 巴金</h2>
<div>Ba Jin, Cold Night (Han ye), 1947 <span>✓<span></div>
<p>
his last novel, Cold Night (Han ye). Written between 1944 and
1946 and published in 1947, Cold Night revolves around a middle-class family of
four inChongqing.The triangularrelationships between the main characters –
husband, wife, and mother-in-law – lead to tragedy; life for each is suffused
with an overwhelming sense of powerlessness, especially on the part of the
husband, who is too meek and inarticulate to resolve the escalating tension
between his wife and his mother. None of the characters is a “bad person,” but
they are bound ultimately by their personalities, whichresult in clashing needs
and aspirations. In the end, the wife comes back without marrying her boss,
but her husband has died of tuberculosis, and her son and her mother-in-law
have moved away
</p>


<h2>12	彷徨 鲁迅</h2>
<div>Lu Xun, Wandering (Panghuang), 1926 <span>✓<span></div>

<h2>13	官场现形记 	李伯元</h2>
<div>Li Baojia, Exposure of Officialdom, 1903</div>

<p>
Li Boyuan was a friend of Wu Jianren and another important late Qing
satirist. His Exposure of Officialdom appeared in serialization in 1903. Unlike
Eyewitness Reports, which aims at the wholesale ridicule of late Qing society,
Exposure emphasizes one social stratum – officialdom – treating it as a selfcontained miniature world. The novel enumerates the outrageous practices
of officials, such as bribery, mismanagement, embezzlement, and, above all,
the buying and selling of posts, concluding that these practices have undermined the millennia-old system of civil service examinations and bureaucratic
governance.
</p>

<h2>14	财主的儿女们 路翎</h2>
<div>Lu Ling, Children of the Rich (Caizhu de ernu men), 1945</div>
<p>
Lu Ling started writing the novel Children
of the Rich (Caizhu de ernu men) at the age of eighteen. The plot revolves
around the three sons of the wealthy Jiang family in Suzhou in decline and
disintegration. The eldest son is handsome and smart, but he is too weak to
confront his wife’s greed and promiscuity. Driven to madness, he burns down
the family mansion and drowns himself in a river. The second son loses to
his scheming sister-in-law in the fight for the family fortune and turns into
a cultural conservative. The youngest son is proud and idealistic; he tries to
carve out a new path for himself but experiences nothing but disillusionment
and loss of love. He dies alone in a village in Chongqing.
</p>
<p>
An anti-Bildungsroman,Children oftheRichpaints a bleak picture of lost youth
in a time of national crisis. Under the influence of Hu Feng, who opposed
shallowromanticism and formulaicwriting, Lu Ling developed an unflinching
realism in all of his characters. 
</p>

<h2>15	将军族 	陈映真</h2>
<div>Chen Yangzhi, The Tribe of Generals” (Jiangjun zu), 196?</div>

<p>
“The Tribe of Generals” (Jiangjun zu). In
the last story, the two protagonists do not even have names: the middle-aged
veteran from the mainland is known by his nickname Triangle Face, while
the young girl from south Taiwan, with a limp from polio, is simply called
“she” and “skinny little girl.” They first meet as members of a traveling band.
Triangle Face learns that the girl had been sold by her family to a pimp but ran
away and became a clown in the band. One morning he leaves her his entire
pension to pay off her family debt and disappears. Five years later, they meet
again in a marching band; fully grown now, she is a baton twirler. He learns
that his pension did not save her as he had intended; instead, she was sold
off to another pimp, who blinded her in one eye and forced her to work as a
prostitute. Eventually, she saved enough money to redeem herself and went
looking for him so that she could pay him back. The next morning, their dead
bodies are discovered in the field, lying side by side, dressed in their shining
band uniforms.
</p>

<h2>16	沉沦 	郁达夫</h2>
<div> Yu Dafu, Sinking (Chenlun), 1921</div>

<p>
Romantic passion was first fully expressed in the works of Yu Dafu (1896–
1945). Like Lu Xun, Yu Dafu studied in Japan and this overseas experience
propelled him to write. But whereas Lu Xun was traumatized by China’s
fate, which he had seen as embodied in the slide showing the decapitation,
Yu Dafu occupied himself with romantic longings and sexual frustration.
In his first short story, “Sinking” (Chenlun, 1921), a young Chinese student
studying in Japan yearns for love, but his romantic longings are continually
thwarted by frustrated patriotism, hypochondria, and an inferiority complex.
Finally, the protagonist walks into the sea, blaming his impending death on
his nation: “O China, my China, you are the cause of my death . . . I wish you
could become rich and strong soon! . . . Many, many of your children are still
suffering.”
<p>
</p>
“Sinking”scandalized thereaders of1920sChinawith its unabashed impulse
toward confession and its explicit descriptions of erotic fantasy, masturbation,
and prostitution. Yu creates a different kind of Madman, one deeply troubled
by his libidinous drive, which can become as ferocious as cannibalism. The
story presents an almost promiscuous mixture of literary heritages, including the confessional style of the Japanese I-novel, the “superfluous man” of
nineteenth-century Russian fiction (such as Rudin), and the rebellious posture of Rousseauistic narrative. Yu’s predilection for classical Chinese poetry,
particularly that which deals with exile and estrangement, lends his narrative
a mannerism reminiscent of traditional elite culture.
</p>

<h2>17	死水微澜 	李人颉</h2>
<h2>18	红高粱 	莫言</h2>
<h2>19	小二黑结婚 	赵树理</h2>
<h2>20	棋王 	阿城</h2>
<div>Ah Cheng, The King of Chess</div>


<p>
Roots-searching literature found a powerful representation in King of Chess
(Qi wang) by Ah Cheng. Published in the July 1984 issue of Shanghai Literature,
the novella features Wang Yisheng, whose given name means literally “one
life” or “one student.” An “educated youth” raised by a widowed mother,
Wang is only interested in two things in life: having enough to eat and playing
chess. In contrast to the other chess players in the story, Wang is not bound by
book learning or motivated by the desire for success and fame. Like a Daoist,
he does not “discriminate” and learns from “people everywhere,” especially
the old garbage collector who tells him, “Playing chess nourishes your nature,
and your livelihood could damage your nature.” By living in the simplest
form and “playing Daoist chess,” Wang is ready to embark on a spiritual
journey.
</p>
<p>
In the climax of the story, Wang plays against nine finalists in a championship game: “[He] was sitting alone in the room facing us, his hands on his knees,
a slender pillar of iron that seemed to hear and see nothing.” “Nothing” evokes
the Daoist mind of nonbeing and noninterference, the shedding of egotism
and forgetting of all worldly concerns. It is at this moment that Wang has
completed theself-transformation from a “chess freak” (qichi) at the beginning
of the story to a “chess king.”
</p>

<h2>21	家变 	王文兴</h2>
<div>Wang Wenxing, Family Catastrophe (Jia Bian), </div>
<p>
Wang began to work on his first novel Family
Catastrophe ( Jia bian) in 1966 and published it in 1973. The work sparked
controversy for both its form and its content. The “catastrophe” in the title
ostensibly refers to the disappearance of the protagonist’s aging father, who
walks out on his wife and son with nothing but the shirt on his back. The
fruitless search for his whereabouts is interspersed with vignettes from the
past, which reveal the escalating tension between the man and his son, who
has come to see him as a failure and the family system as hypocritical and
oppressive. Ironically, in the absence of the father, the family thrives.
</p>
<p>
Family Catastrophe was criticized for its “heretical” ideas as well as for its
experimental language that was sprinkled with neologisms, erratic syntax, and
Chinese phonetic symbols.
