 A:   Oh    great!    This   stupid   computer     froze   again!       That ’s  the  third  time  today!      Hey  Samuel,  can       you come take a look at my PC? It ’s acting up       again. It must have a virus or something.  B:   Just give me a second; I ’ll be right up.  B:    I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns       out that you have a lot of infected ﬁles!  A:    But  I ’m  quite  careful  when  I ’m  browsing  the       internet,  I have no idea how I could have picked       up a virus.  B:   Well,  you have to make sure that your anti-virus       software is updated regularly; yours wasn’t up to       date, that’s probably what was causing your prob-        lems.  A:   Ok. Anything else?  B:    Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer!  A:     Um yeah& Sorry about that.
