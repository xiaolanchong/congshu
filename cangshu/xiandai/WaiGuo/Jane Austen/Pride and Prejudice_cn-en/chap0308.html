<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his
life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid
by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and
of his wife, if she survived him.  He now wished it more than
ever.  Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not
have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or
credit could now be purchased for her.  The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great
Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper
place.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特先生远在好久以前，就希望每年的进款<BR>
不要全部花光，能够积蓄一部分，让儿女往后<BR>
不至于衣食匮乏；如果太太比他命长，衣食便<BR>
也有了着落。拿目前来说，他这个希望比以往<BR>
来得更迫切。要是他在这方面早就安排好了，<BR>
那么这次丽迪雅挽回面子名誉的事，自然就不<BR>
必要她舅舅为她花钱；也不必让舅舅去说服全<BR>
英国最下流的一个青年的她确定夫妇的名份。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage
to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his
brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out
the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation
as soon as he could.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be
perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.
This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he
should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by
that means be provided for.  Five daughters successively
entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and
Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been
certain that he would.  This event had at last been despaired
of, but it was then too late to be saving.  Mrs. Bennet had no
turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had
alone prevented their exceeding their income.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特先生刚结婚的时候，完全不必省吃俭用<BR>

少年以后，班纳特太太还一直以为会生儿子。<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on
Mrs. Bennet and the children.  But in what proportions it
should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of
the parents.  This was one point, with regard to Lydia at
least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have
no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.  In terms
of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,
though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his
perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness
to fulfill the engagements that had been made for him.  He had
never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to
marry his daughter, it would be done with so little
inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement.  He
would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the hundred
that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to
her through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very
little within that sum.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">当年老夫妇的婚约上规定了班纳特太太和子女<BR>
们一共应享有五千磅遗产。至于子女们究竟怎<BR>
样分享，得由父母在遗嘱上解决，班纳特先生<BR>
毫不犹豫地同意了摆在他面前的那个建议。他<BR>
回信给舅爷，多谢他一片好心。他的措辞极其<BR>
简洁，只说他对一切既成事实都表示赞同，而<BR>
且舅爷所提出的各项条件，他都愿意照办。原<BR>
来这次说服韦翰跟他女儿结婚一事，竟安排得<BR>
这样好，简直没有带给他什么麻烦，这实在是<BR>
他所意料不到的。虽说他每年要付给他们俩一<BR>
百镑，可是事实上他每年还损失不了十镑，因<BR>
为丽迪雅在家里也要吃用开销，外加她母亲还<BR>
要贴钱给她花，计算起来每年几乎也不下于一<BR>
百镑。<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,
too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at
present was to have as little trouble in the business as
possible.  When the first transports of rage which had produced
his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to
all his former indolence.  His letter was soon dispatched; for
though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its
execution.  He begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to
send any message to her.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">还有一件可喜的意外，那就是办起这件事来，<BR>
他自己简直可以不费什么力气，他目前最希望<BR>
麻烦越少戛好。他开头也曾因为一时冲动，亲<BR>

得象往常一样懒散。他把那封回信立刻寄出去<BR>
；虽然做事喜欢拖延，可是只要他肯动手，倒<BR>
也完成得很快。他在信上请他舅爷把一切代劳<BR>
之处详详细细告诉他，可是说起丽迪雅，实在<BR>
使他太气恼，因此连问候也没有问候她一声。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The good news quickly spread through the house; and with
proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.  It was borne in
the latter with decent philosophy.  To be sure, it would have
been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia
Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative,
been secluded from the world in some distant farm house.
But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded
before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but
little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because
with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">好消息立刻在全家传开了，而且很快便传到邻<BR>
舍们耳朵里去。四邻八舍对这件事都抱着相当<BR>

亲自上这儿来了，或者说，如果她恰恰相反，<BR>
远隔尘嚣，住到一个偏僻的农村里去，那就可<BR>
以给人家增加许多谈话的资料。不过她的出嫁<BR>
问题毕竟还是使人家议论纷纷。麦里屯那些恶<BR>
毒的老太婆，原先总是一番好心肠，祝她嫁个<BR>
如意夫君，如今虽然眼看着情境变了，也不是<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but
on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her
table, and in spirits oppressively high.  No sentiment of shame
gave a damp to her triumph.  The marriage of a daughter, which
had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen,
was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and
her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials,
fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.  She was busily
searching through the neighbourhood for a "proper situation"
for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what
their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

the servants remained.  But when they had withdrawn, he said
to her, "Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these
houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right
understanding.  Into one house in this neighbourhood, they
shall never have admittance.  I will not encourage the
impudence of either by receiving them at Longbourn."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">A long dispute followed this declaration, but Mr. Bennet was
firm; it soon led to another, and Mrs. Bennet found, with
amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a
guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.  He protested that she
should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the
occasion.  Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it.  That his
anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which
her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she
could believe possible.  She was more alive to the disgrace
which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's
nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living
with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.

There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more
confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one
whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her
so much.  Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it
individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf
impassable between them.  Had Lydia's marriage been concluded
on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every
other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship
of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.

shrink.  The wish of procuring her regard, which she had
assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in
rational expectation survive such a blow as this.  She was
humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew
of what.  She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no

might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his
judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.  But no such happy
marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial
felicity really was.  An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed
in their family.

Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his
former friends, there are still some who are able and willing
to assist him in the army.  He has the promise of an ensigncy
in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North.  It is
an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.
He promises fairly; and, I hope, among different people, where
they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
more prudent.  I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him
of our present arrangements, and to request that he will
satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near
Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have
pledged myself.  And will you give yourself the trouble of
carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of
whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information.

Longbourn as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed

受到父母的重视，再三要求父亲，让妹妹和妹<BR>

说动了心，同意了她们的想法，愿意照着她们<BR>

把她当作宝贝似的显给街坊四邻看看。于是班<BR>
