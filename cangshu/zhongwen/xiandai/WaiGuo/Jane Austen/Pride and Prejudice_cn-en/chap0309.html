</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt
for her probably more than she felt for herself.  The carriage
was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by
dinner-time.  Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss
Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings
which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit,
and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">妹妹的婚期到了，吉英和伊丽莎白都为她担心<BR>
，恐怕比妹妹自己担心得还要厉害。家里打发<BR>
了一部马车到某某地方去接新夫妇，吃中饭时<BR>
他们就可以来到。两位姐姐都怕他们来，尤其<BR>
是吉英怕得厉害。她设身处地地想：要是丽迪<BR>
雅这次丑行发生在她自己身上，她一定会感触<BR>
万千，再想到妹妹心里的难受，便越发觉得不<BR>
好过。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">They came.  The family were assembled in the breakfast room to
receive them.  Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the
carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably
grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">新夫妇来了。全家都集合在起居室里迎接他们<BR>
。当马车停在门前的时候，班纳特太太满面堆<BR>
着笑容，她丈夫却板着脸。女儿们又是惊奇又<BR>
是焦急，而且十分不安。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown
open, and she ran into the room.  Her mother stepped forwards,
embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand,
with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady;
and wished them both joy with an alacrity which showed no doubt
of their happiness.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">只听得门口已经有了丽迪雅说话的声音，一会<BR>
儿，门给打开了，丽迪雅跑进屋来。母亲高兴<BR>
得要命，连忙走上前来欢迎她，拥抱她，一面<BR>
又带着亲切的笑容把手伸给韦翰（他走在新妇<BR>
后面），祝他们夫妇俩快活。班太太的话讲得<BR>
那么响亮，说明了她相信他们俩一定会幸福。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned,
was not quite so cordial.  His countenance rather gained in
austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.  The easy
assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke
him.  Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was
shocked.  Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild,
noisy, and fearless.  She turned from sister to sister,
demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all
sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some
little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it
was a great while since she had been there.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">然后新夫妇转身到班纳特先生跟前，他对他们<BR>
可没有他太太那么热诚。只见他的脸色显得分<BR>
外严峻，连嘴也不张一下。这一对年轻夫妇那<BR>
种安然自得的样子，实在叫他生气。伊丽莎白<BR>
觉得厌恶，连吉英也禁不住感到惊骇。丽迪雅<BR>
还是丽迪雅──不安分，不害羞，撒野吵嚷，<BR>
天不怕地不怕的。她从这个姐姐跟前走到那个<BR>
姐姐跟前，要她们一个个恭喜她。最后大家都<BR>
坐下来了，她连忙扫视了一下这间屋子，看到<BR>
里面稍许有些改变，便笑着说，好久不曾到这<BR>
儿来了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his
manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his
marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy
address, while he claimed their relationship, would have
delighted them all.  Elizabeth had not before believed him
quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving
within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of
an impudent man.  <I>She</I> blushed, and Jane blushed; but the
cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no
variation of colour.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">韦翰更没有一点难受的样子。他的仪表一向亲<BR>
切动人，要是他为人正派一些，聚亲合乎规矩<BR>
一些，那么，这次来拜见岳家，他那笑容可掬<BR>
、谈吐安详的样子，自然会讨人家欢喜。伊丽<BR>
莎白从来不相信他竟会这样厚颜无耻，她坐下<BR>
来思忖道：一个人不要起脸来可真是漫无止境<BR>
。她不禁红了脸，吉英也红了脸；可是那两位<BR>
当事人，别人都为他们难为情，他们自己却面<BR>
不改色。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">There was no want of discourse.  The bride and her mother could
neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to
sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in
that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt
very unable to equal in her replies.  They seemed each of them
to have the happiest memories in the world.  Nothing of the
past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to
subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the
world.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这个场合确实是不愁没有话谈。新娘和她母亲<BR>
只觉得有话来不及说；韦翰凑巧坐在伊丽莎白<BR>
身旁，便向她问起附近一带的熟人近况如何，<BR>
问得极其和悦从容，弄得她反而不能对答如流<BR>
。这一对夫妇俨然心安理得，毫无羞耻之心。<BR>
他们想起过去的事，心里丝毫不觉得难受；丽<BR>
迪雅又不由自主地谈到了许多事情──要是换<BR>
了她姐姐们，这种事情是无论如何也说不出口<BR>
的。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I
went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there
have been things enough happened in the time.  Good gracious!
when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married
till I came back again!  though I thought it would be very good
fun if I was."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">只听得丽迪雅大声说道：“且想想看，我已经<BR>
走了三个月了！好象还只有两个星期呢；可是<BR>
时间虽短，却发生了多少事情。天啊！我走的<BR>
时候，的确想也没想到这次要结了婚再回来，<BR>
不过我也想到：如果真就这样结了婚，倒也挺<BR>
有趣的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Her father lifted up his eyes.  Jane was distressed.  Elizabeth
looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw
any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,
"Oh!  mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married
to-day?  I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William
Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know
it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off
my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so
that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like
any thing."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">父亲瞪着眼睛。吉英很难受，伊丽莎白啼笑皆<BR>
非地望着丽迪雅；可是丽迪雅，凡是她不愿意<BR>
知道的事，她一概不闻不问，她仍然得意洋洋<BR>
地说下去：“噢，妈妈，附近的人们都知道我<BR>
今天结婚了吗？我怕他们还不见得都知道；我<BR>
们一路来的时候，追上了威廉・戈丁的马车，<BR>
这为了要让他知道我结婚了，便把我自己车子<BR>
上的一扇玻璃窗放了下来，又脱下手套，把手<BR>
放在窗口，好让他看见我手上的戒指，然后我<BR>
又对他点点头笑得什么似的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth could bear it no longer.  She got up, and ran out of
the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing
through the hall to the dining parlour.  She then joined them
soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her
mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,
"Ah!  Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower,
because I am a married woman."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白实在忍无可忍了，只得站起身来跑回<BR>
屋外去，一直听到她们走过穿堂，进入饭厅，<BR>
她才回来。来到她们这里，又见丽迪雅急急匆<BR>
匆大摇大摆走到母亲右边，一面对她的大姐姐<BR>
说：“喂，吉英，这次我要坐你的位子了，你<BR>
得坐到下手去，因为我已经是出了嫁的姑娘。<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that
embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.
Her ease and good spirits increased.  She longed to see Mrs.
Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to
hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham" by each of them; and in the
mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of
being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">丽迪雅既然从开头起就完全不觉得难为情，这<BR>
时候当然更是若无其事。她反而越来越不在乎<BR>
，越来兴头越高。她很想去看看腓力普太太，<BR>
看看卢卡斯全家人，还要把所有的邻居都统统<BR>
拜访一遍，让大家都叫她韦翰太太。吃过中饭<BR>
，她立刻把结婚戒指显给希尔奶奶和其他两个<BR>
女佣人看，夸耀她自己已经结了婚。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the
breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband?  Is not
he a charming man?  I am sure my sisters must all envy me.  I
only hope they may have half my good luck.  They must all go to
Brighton.  That is the place to get husbands.  What a pity it
is, mamma, we did not all go."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">大家都回到起坐间以后，她又说道：“妈妈，<BR>
你觉得我丈夫怎么样？他不是挺可爱吗？姐姐<BR>
们一定都要羡慕我。但愿她们有我一半运气就<BR>
好啦。谁叫她们不到白利屯去。那里才是个找<BR>
丈夫的地方。真可惜，妈妈，我们没有大家一<BR>
起去！”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.  But my dear
Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.  Must it
be so?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你讲得真对；要是照我的意见，我们早就应<BR>
该一起都去。可是，丽迪雅宝贝儿，我不愿意<BR>
你到那么远的地方去。你难道非去不可吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh, lord!  yes; -- there is nothing in that.  I shall like it
of all things.  You and papa, and my sisters, must come down
and see us.  We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I
dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get
good partners for them all."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“天啊！当然非去不可，那有什么关系。我真<BR>
高兴极了。你和爸爸，还有姐姐们，一定要来<BR>

们找到很好舞伴。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那我真是再喜欢也没有了！”母亲说。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my
sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for
them before the winter is over."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“等你动身回家的时候，你可以让一两个姐姐<BR>

找到丈夫。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth;
"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白连忙说：“谢谢你的关怀，可惜你这<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.
Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London,
and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">新夫妇只能和家里相聚十天。韦翰先生在没有<BR>
离开伦敦之前就已经受到了委任，必须在两星<BR>
期以内就到团部去报到。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so
short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with
her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.  These
parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was
even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">只有班纳特太太一个人惋惜他们行期太匆促，<BR>
因此她尽量抓紧时间，陪着女儿到处走亲访友<BR>
，又常常在家里宴客。这些宴会大家都欢迎：<BR>
没有心思的人固然愿意赴宴，有心思的人更愿<BR>
意借这个机会出去解解闷。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had
expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.  She had
scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from
the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on
by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would
have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose
to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his
flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an
opportunity of having a companion.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">果然不出伊丽莎白所料，韦翰对丽迪雅的恩爱<BR>
比不上丽迪雅对韦翰那样深厚。从一切事实上<BR>
都可以看出来，他们的私奔多半是因为丽迪雅<BR>
热爱韦翰，而不是因为韦翰热爱丽迪雅，这在<BR>
伊丽莎白看来，真是一件显而易见的事。至于<BR>
说，他既然并不十分爱她为什么还要跟她私奔<BR>
，伊丽莎白一点也不觉得奇怪，因为她断定韦<BR>
翰这次为债务所逼，本来非逃跑不可；那么，<BR>
象他这样一个青年，路上有一个女人陪陪他，<BR>
他当然不表错过机会。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.  He was her dear Wickham on
every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.
He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would
kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else
in the country.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">丽迪雅太喜欢他了，她每说一句话就要叫一声<BR>
亲爱的韦翰。谁也比不上他。他无论做什么事<BR>

他射到的鸟一定比全国任何人都要多。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with
her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他们来到这儿没有多少时候，有一天早晨，丽<BR>
迪雅跟两位姐姐坐在一起，对伊丽莎白说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Lizzy, I never gave <I>you</I> an account of my wedding, I believe.
You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“丽萃，我还没有跟你讲起过我结婚的情形呢<BR>
。我跟妈妈和别的姐姐们讲的时候，你都不在<BR>
场。你难道不想要听听这场喜事是怎么办的吗<BR>
？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too
little said on the subject."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不想听，真不想听，”伊丽莎白回答道：“<BR>
我认为这桩事谈得不算少了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"La!  You are so strange!  But I must tell you how it went off.
We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's
lodgings were in that parish.  And it was settled that we
should all be there by eleven o'clock.  My uncle and aunt and I
were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the
church.  Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!
I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put
it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.  And
there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and
talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.  However, I
did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may
suppose, of my dear Wickham.  I longed to know whether he would
be married in his blue coat."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“哎呀！你这个人太奇怪！我一定要把经过情<BR>
形告诉你。你知道，我们是在圣克利门教学结<BR>
的婚，因为韦翰住在那个教区里面。大家约定<BR>
十一点钟到那儿。舅父母跟我一块儿去的，别<BR>
的人都约定在教堂里碰头。唔，到了星期一早<BR>
上，我真是慌张得要命。你知道，我真怕会发<BR>
生什么意外，把婚期耽搁了，那我可真要发狂<BR>
了。我在打扮，舅母一直不住嘴地讲呀，说呀<BR>
，好象是在传道似的。她十句话我最多听进一<BR>
句，你可以想象得到，我那时一心在惦记着我<BR>
亲爱的韦翰。我一心想要知道。他是不是穿着<BR>
他那件蓝衣服去结婚。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it
would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand,
that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I
was with them.  If you'll believe me, I did not once put my
foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.  Not one
party, or scheme, or any thing.  To be sure London was rather
thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.  Well, and so
just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away
upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.  And then, you
know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.
Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my
uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we
could not be married all day.  But, luckily, he came back again
in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out.  However, I
recollected afterwards that if he <I>had</I> been prevented going,
the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done
as well."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“唔，象平常一样，我们那天是十点钟吃早饭<BR>
的。我只觉得一顿饭老是吃不完，说到这里，<BR>
我得顺便告诉你，我待在舅父母那儿的一段时<BR>
期，他们一直很不高兴。说来你也许不信，我<BR>
虽在那儿待了两个星期，却没有出过家门一步<BR>
。没有参加过一次宴会，没有一点儿消遗，真<BR>
过得无聊透顶。老实说，伦敦虽然并不太热闹<BR>
，不过那个小戏院还是开着。言归正传，那天<BR>
马车来了，舅父却让那个名叫史桐先生的讨厌<BR>
家伙叫去有事。你知道，他们俩一碰头，就不<BR>
想分手。我真给吓坏了，不知道怎么是好，因<BR>
这需要舅父送嫁；要是我们误了钟点，那天就<BR>
结不成婚。幸亏他不到十分钟就回来了，于是<BR>
我们一块儿动身。不过我后来又想起来了，要<BR>
是他真补缠住了不能分身，婚期也不会延迟，<BR>
因为还有达西先生可以代劳。”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh, yes! -- he was to come there with Wickham, you know, But

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it
out of her power, by running away.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她这话明明是怂恿伊丽莎白问下去，伊丽莎白<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at
least it was impossible not to try for information.  Mr. Darcy
had been at her sister's wedding.  It was exactly a scene, and
exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and
least temptation to go.  Conjectures as to the meaning of it,
rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied
with none.  Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct
in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.  She could not
bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote
a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which
had been intended.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">但是，这件事是不可能不闻不问的，至少也得<BR>

想来想去，把各种各样古怪的念头都想到了，<BR>
可还是想不，出一个所以然来。她当然愿意从<BR>
最好的方面去想，认为他这次是胸襟宽大，有<BR>
心表示好意，可是她这种想法又未免太不切合<BR>
实际。她无论如何也摸不着头脑，实在难受，<BR>
于是连忙拿起一张纸，写了封短短的信给舅母<BR>
，请求她把丽迪雅刚才无意中泄露出来的那句<BR>
话解释一下，只要与原来保守秘密的计划能够<BR>
并行不悖就是了。<BR></TD>

must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and
(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have
been amongst you at such a time.  Pray write instantly, and let
me understand it -- unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to
remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and
then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."

我们非亲非眷，而且跟我们家里相当陌生，竟<BR>
会跟你们一同参加这次婚礼，这叫我怎么能够<BR>

事情弄明白。如果确实如丽迪雅所说，此事非<BR>
保守秘密不可，那我也只得不闻不问了。”<BR></TD>

in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was
glad of it; -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would
receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a
confidante.
