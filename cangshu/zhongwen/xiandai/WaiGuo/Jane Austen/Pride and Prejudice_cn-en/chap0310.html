letter as soon as she possibly could.  She was no sooner in
possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where
she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of
the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the
letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.

<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">亲爱的甥女：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing
will not comprise what I have to tell you.  I must confess
myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from
<I>you</I>.  Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let
you know that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary
on <I>your</I> side.  If you do not choose to understand me, forgive
my impertinence.  Your uncle is as much surprised as I am --
and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done.  But if you are
really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.  On the
very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a
most unexpected visitor.  Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up
with him several hours.  It was all over before I arrived; so
my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as <I>your's</I> seems to
have been.  He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out
where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen
and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after
ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them.  The motive professed was his conviction of its being
owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so
well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of
character to love or confide in him.  He generously imputed the
whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before
thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the
world.  His character was to speak for itself.  He called it,
therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an
evil which had been brought on by himself.  If he <I>had</I>
<I>another</I> motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.  He
had been some days in town, before he was able to discover
them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more
than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason
for his resolving to follow us.  There is a lady, it seems, a
Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and
was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation,
though he did not say what.  She then took a large house in
Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings.  This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted
with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as
soon as he got to town.  But it was two or three days before he
could get from her what he wanted.  She would not betray her
trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she
really did know where her friend was to be found.  Wickham
indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and
had she been able to receive them into her house, they would
have taken up their abode with her.  At length, however, our
kind friend procured the wished-for direction.  They were in
---- street.  He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing
Lydia.  His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to
persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and
return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to
receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she
was.  She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of
his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.  She was sure they
should be married some time or other, and it did not much
signify when.  Since such were her feelings, it only remained,
he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his
very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had
never been his design.  He confessed himself obliged to leave
the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were
very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences
of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone.  He meant to resign
his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he
could conjecture very little about it.  He must go somewhere,
but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing
to live on.  Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your
sister at once.  Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very
rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his
situation must have been benefited by marriage.  But he found,
in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the
hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some
other country.  Under such circumstances, however, he was not
likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.
They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length
was reduced to be reasonable.  Every thing being settled
between <I>them</I>, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle
acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street
the evening before I came home.  But Mr. Gardiner could not be
seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father
was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.  He
did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so
properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
seeing him till after the departure of the former.  He did not
leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a
gentleman had called on business.  On Saturday he came again.
Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said
before, they had a great deal of talk together.  They met again
on Sunday, and then <I>I</I> saw him too.  It was not all settled
before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to
Longbourn.  But our visitor was very obstinate.  I fancy,
Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,
after all.  He has been accused of many faults at different
times, but <I>this</I> is the true one.  Nothing was to be done that
he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it
to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle
would most readily have settled the whole.  They battled it
together for a long time, which was more than either the
gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.  But at last your
uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be
of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the
probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and
I really believe your letter this morning gave him great
pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him
of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at
most.  You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for
the young people.  His debts are to be paid, amounting, I
believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another
thousand in addition to her own settled upon <I>her</I>, and his
commission purchased.  The reason why all this was to be done
by him alone, was such as I have given above.  It was owing to
him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that
Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently
that he had been received and noticed as he was.  Perhaps there
was some truth in <I>this</I>; though I doubt whether <I>his</I> reserve,
or <I>anybody's</I> reserve, can be answerable for the event.  But
in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest
perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if
we had not given him credit for <I>another</I> <I>interest</I> in the
affair.  When all this was resolved on, he returned again to
his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was
agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding
took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last
finish.  I believe I have now told you every thing.  It is a
relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise;
I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.
Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the
house.  <I>He</I> was exactly what he had been when I knew him in
Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was
satisfied with her behaviour while she stayed with us, if I
had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her
conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and
therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done,
and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.  If she
heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not
listen.  I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected
my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience
with her.  Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia
informed you, attended the wedding.  He dined with us the next
day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.
Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this
opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say
before) how much I like him.  His behaviour to us has, in every
respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.  His
understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
a little more liveliness, and <I>that</I>, if he marry <I>prudently</I>,
his wife may teach him.  I thought him very sly; -- he hardly
ever mentioned your name.  But slyness seems the fashion.  Pray
forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from P.  I shall never be
quite happy till I have been all round the park.  A low
phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very
thing.  But I must write no more.  The children have been
wanting me this half hour.  Your's, very sincerely,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">刚刚接到你的来信，我便决定以整个上午的时<BR>
间来给你写回信，因为我估料三言两语不能够<BR>
把我要跟你讲的话讲个明白。我得承认，你所<BR>
提出的要求很使我诧异，我没有料到提出这个<BR>
要求的竟会是你。请你不要以为我这是生气的<BR>
话，我不过说，我实在想象有到你居然还要来<BR>
问。如果你一定装作听不懂我的话，那只有请<BR>
你原谅我失礼了。你舅父也跟我同样地诧异，<BR>
我们都认为，达西所以要那样做，完全是为了<BR>
你的缘故。如果你当真一点也不知道，那也只<BR>
好让我来跟你说说明白了。就在我从浪搏恩回<BR>
家的那一天，有一个意想不到的客人来乍你舅<BR>
父。那人原来就是达西先生，他跟你舅父关起<BR>
门来，密谈了好几个钟头。等我到家的时候，<BR>
事情已经过去了，我当时倒并没有象你现在这<BR>
样好奇。他是因为发觉了你妹妹和韦翰的下落<BR>
，特地赶来告诉嘉丁纳先生一声。他说，他已<BR>
经看到过他们，而且跟他们谈过话──跟韦翰<BR>
谈过好多次，跟丽迪雅谈过一次。据我看，我<BR>
们离开德比郡的第二天，达西就动身赶到城里<BR>
来找他们了。他说，事情弄到如此地步，都怪<BR>
他不好，没有及早揭露韦翰的下流品格，否则<BR>
就不会有哪一位正派姑娘会把他当作知心，会<BR>
爱上他了。他概然引咎自责，认为这次的事情<BR>
都得怪他当初太傲慢，因为他以前认为韦翰的<BR>
品格自然而然会让别人看穿，不必把他的私人<BR>
行为都一一揭露出来，免得使他自己有失体统<BR>
，他认为这都是他自己一手造成的罪恶，因此<BR>
他这次出面调停，设法补救实在是义不容辞。<BR>
他自己承认他要干预这件事的动机就是如此。<BR>
如果他当真别有用心，也不会使他丢脸。他在<BR>
城里待了好几天才找到他们；可是他有线索可<BR>
找，我们可没有。他也是因为自信有这点把握<BR>
，才下定决心紧跟着我们而来。好象有一位扬<BR>
吉太太，她早先做过达西小姐的家庭教师，后<BR>
来犯了什么过错（他没有讲明）被解雇了，便<BR>
在爱德华街弄了一幢大房子，分租过活。达西<BR>
知道这位杨吉太太跟韦翰极其相熟，于是他一<BR>
到城里，便上她那儿去打听他的消息。他花了<BR>
两三天工夫，才从她那儿把事情探听明白。我<BR>
想，杨吉太太早就知道韦翰的下落，可是不给<BR>
她贿赂她决不肯讲出来。他们俩确实是一到伦<BR>
敦便到她那里去，要是她能够留他们住，他们<BR>
早就住在她那儿了。我们这位好心的朋友终于<BR>
探听出了他们在某某街的住址，于是他先去看<BR>
韦翰，然后他又非要看到丽迪雅不可。据他说<BR>
，他第一件事就是劝丽迪雅改邪归正，一等到<BR>
和家里人说通了，就赶快回去，还答应替她帮<BR>
忙到底，可是他发觉丽迪雅坚决要那样搞下去<BR>
，家里人一个都不在她心上。她不要他帮助，<BR>
她无论如何也不肯丢掉韦翰。她断定他们俩迟<BR>
早总要结婚，早一天迟一天毫无关系。于是他<BR>
想，他第一次跟韦翰谈话的时候，明明发觉对<BR>
方毫无结婚的打算，如今既是丽迪雅存着这样<BR>
的念头，当然只有赶快促成他们结婚。韦翰曾<BR>
经亲口承认，他当初所以要从民兵团里逃出来<BR>
，完全是由于为赌债所逼，至于丽迪雅这次私<BR>
奔所引起的不良后果，他竟毫不犹豫地把它完<BR>
全归罪于她自己的愚蠢。他说他马上就要辞职<BR>
，讲到事业前途，他简直不堪设想。他应该到<BR>
一个什么地方去找份差事，可是又不知道究竟<BR>
去哪儿，他知道他快要没有钱生活下去了。达<BR>
西先生问他为什么没有立刻跟你妹妹结婚，虽<BR>
然班纳特先生算不上什么大阔人，可是也能够<BR>
帮他一些忙，他结婚以后，境况一定会有利一<BR>
些。但是他发觉韦翰回答这话的时候，仍然指<BR>
望到别的地方去另外攀门亲，以便扎扎实实地<BR>
赚进一笔钱。不过，他目前的情况既是如此，<BR>
如果有救急的办法，他也未始不会心动。他们<BR>
见了好几次面，因为有好多地方都得当面商讨<BR>
。韦翰当然漫天讨价，结果总算减少到一个合<BR>
理的数目。他们之间一切都商谈好了，达西先<BR>
生的下一个步骤就是把这件事告诉你舅父，于<BR>
是他就在我回家的前一天晚上，到天恩寺街来<BR>
进行第一次访问。当时嘉丁纳先生不在家；达<BR>
西先生打听到你父亲那天还住在这儿，不过第<BR>
二天早晨就要走。他以为你父亲不是象你舅父<BR>
那样一个好商量的人，因此，决定等到你父亲<BR>
走了以后，再来看你舅父。他当时没有留下姓<BR>
名，直到第二天，我们还只知道有位某某先生<BR>
到这儿来过，找他有事，星期六他又来了。那<BR>
天你父亲已经走了，你舅父在家，正如我刚才<BR>
说过的，他们俩便在一起谈了许久。他们星期<BR>
天又见了面，当时我也看见他的。事情一直到<BR>
星期一才完全谈妥。一谈妥之后，就派专人送<BR>
信到浪搏恩来。但是我们这位贵客实在太固执<BR>
。人们都纷纷指责他的错处，今天说他有这个<BR>
错处，明天又说他有那个错处，可是这一个才<BR>
是他真正的错处。样样事情都非得由他亲自来<BR>
办不可；其实你舅父非常愿意全盘包办（我这<BR>
样说并不是为了讨你的好，所以请你不要跟别<BR>
人提起）。他们为这件事争执了好久，其实对<BR>
当事人来说，无论是男方女方，都不配享受这<BR>
样的对待。可是你舅父最后还是不得不依从他<BR>
，以致非但不能替自己的外甥女稍微尽点力，<BR>
而且还要无劳居功，这完全和他的心愿相违；<BR>
我相信你今天早上的来信一定会使他非常高兴<BR>
，因为这件掠人之美的事，从此可以说个清楚<BR>
明白，使那应该受到赞美的人受到赞美。不过<BR>
，丽萃，这件事只能让你知道，最多只能说给<BR>
吉英听。我想你一定会深刻了解到，他对那一<BR>
对青年男女尽了多大的力。我相信他替他偿还<BR>
的债务一定远在一千镑以上，而且除了她自己<BR>
名下的钱以外，另外又给她一千镑，还给他买<BR>
了个官职。至于这些钱为什么得由他一个人付<BR>
，我已经在上面说明理由。他说这都怪他自己<BR>
不好，怪他当初考虑欠妥，矜持过分，以致叫<BR>
人家不明了韦翰的人品，结果使人家上了当，<BR>
把他当做好人。这番话或许真有几分道理；不<BR>
过我却觉得，这种事既不应当怪他矜持过分，<BR>
也不应当怪别人矜持过分。亲爱的丽萃，你应<BR>
当明白，他的话虽然说得这样动听，我们要不<BR>
是鉴于他别有苦心，你舅父决不肯依从他。一<BR>
切事情都决定了以后，他便回到彭伯里去应酬<BR>
他那些朋友，大家同时说定，等到举行婚礼的<BR>
那天，他还得再到伦敦来，办理一切有关金钱<BR>
方面的最后手续。现在我把所有的事情都讲给<BR>
你听了。这就是你所谓会使你大吃一惊的一篇<BR>
叙述；我希望至少不会叫你听了不痛快。丽迪<BR>
雅上我们这儿来住，韦翰也经常来。他完全还<BR>
是上次我在哈福德郡见到他时的那副老样子。<BR>
丽迪雅待在我们这儿时，她的种种行为举止，<BR>
的确叫我很不满，我本来不打算告诉你，不过<BR>
星期三接一以吉英的来信，我才知道她回家依<BR>
然故态复萌，那么告诉了你也不会使你不什么<BR>
新的难过。我几次三番一本正经地跟她说，她<BR>
这件事做得大错特错，害得一家人都痛苦悲伤<BR>
。哪里知道，我的话她听也不要听。有几次我<BR>
非常生气，但是一记起了亲爱的伊丽莎白和吉<BR>
英，看她们面上，我还是容忍着她。达西先生<BR>
准时来到，正如丽迪雅所告诉你的，他参加了<BR>
婚礼。他第二天跟我们在一起吃饭，星期三或<BR>
星期四又要进城去。亲爱的丽萃，要是我利用<BR>
这个机会说，我多么喜欢他（我以前一直没有<BR>
敢这样说），你会生我的气吗？他对待我们的<BR>
态度，从任何方面来说，都跟我们在德比郡的<BR>
时候同样讨人喜爱。他的见识，他的言论，我<BR>
都很喜欢。他没有任何缺点，只不过稍欠活泼<BR>
；关于这一点，只要他结婚结得当心一些，娶<BR>
个好太太，他也许会让她给教好的。我认为他<BR>
很调皮，因为他几乎没有提起过你的名字。但<BR>
是调皮倒好象成了时下的一种风气。如果我说<BR>
得太放肆了，还得请你原谅，至少不要处罚我<BR>
太厉害，将来连彭伯里也不许我去啊。我要把<BR>
那个花园逛遍了，才会心满意足。我只要弄一<BR>
辆矮矮的双轮小马车，驾上一对漂亮的小马就<BR>
行了。我无法再写下去，孩子们已经嚷着要我<BR>
要了半个钟头。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter
of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether
pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.  The vague and
unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what
Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match,
which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness
too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be
just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their
greatest extent to be true!  He had followed them purposely to
town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification
attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been
necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and
where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished
to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to
pronounce.  He had done all this for a girl whom he could
neither regard nor esteem.  Her heart did whisper that he had
done it for her.  But it was a hope shortly checked by other
considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was
insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her
-- for a woman who had already refused him -- as able to
overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against
relationship with Wickham.  Brother-in-law of Wickham!  Every
kind of pride must revolt from the connection.  He had, to be
sure, done much.  She was ashamed to think how much.  But he
had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief.  It was reasonable that he
should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had
the means of exercising it; and though she would not place
herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps,
believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his
endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned.  It was painful, exceedingly painful, to
know that they were under obligations to a person who could
never receive a return.  They owed the restoration of Lydia,
her character, every thing, to him.  Oh!  how heartily did she
grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,
every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.  For
herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.  Proud that
in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself.  She read over her aunt's commendation
of him again and again.  It was hardly enough; but it pleased
her.  She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with
regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had
been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between
Mr. Darcy and herself.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白读了这封信，真是心神摇荡。她这种<BR>
心情，叫人家弄不明白她窨是高兴多于苦痛，<BR>
还是苦痛多于高兴。她本来也曾隐隐约约、疑<BR>
疑惑惑地想到达西先生可能会成全她妹妹的好<BR>
事，可是又不也往这方面多想，怕他不可能好<BR>
心到这个地步；另一方面她又顾虑到，如果他<BR>
当真这样做了，那又未免情意太重，报答不了<BR>
人家，因此她又痛苦。如今这些揣测却成了千<BR>
真万确的事实！想不到他那天竟会跟随着她和<BR>
舅父母赶到城里去。他不惜担当起一切的麻烦<BR>
和艰苦，来探索这件事。他不得不向一个他所<BR>
深恶痛绝、极其鄙视的女人去求情。他不得不<BR>
委曲求全，同一个他极力要国以回避、而且连<BR>
名字也不愿意提起的人去见面，常常见面，跟<BR>
他说理，规劝他，最后还不得不贿赂他。他这<BR>
般仁至义尽，只不过是为了一个他既无好感又<BR>
不器重的姑娘。她心里轻轻地说，他这样做，<BR>
都是为了她。但是，再想到一些别的方面，她<BR>
立刻就不敢再存这个希望。她马上感觉到，她<BR>
本可以从虚荣心出发，认为他确实爱她，可是<BR>
她哪能存着那么大的虚荣心，指望他会爱上一<BR>
个已经拒绝过他的女人！他不愿意跟韦翰做亲<BR>
戚，这种情绪本来也极其自然，又哪能指望他<BR>
去迁就！何况是跟韦翰做连襟！凡是稍有自尊<BR>
心的人，都容忍不了这种亲戚关系。毫无问题<BR>
，他为这件事出了很大的力。她简直不好意思<BR>
去想象他究竟出了多大的力。他所以要过问这<BR>
件事，理由已经由他自己加以说明，你不必多<BR>
费思索就可以深信无疑。他怪他自己当初做事<BR>
欠妥，这自然讲得通；他很慷慨，而且有资格<BR>
可以慷慨；虽然她不愿意认为他这次主要就是<BR>
为了她，可是她也许可以相信，他对她依旧未<BR>
能忘情，因此遇到这样一件与她心境攸关的事<BR>
情，他还是愿意尽心竭力。一想起这样一个人<BR>
对她们情意隆重，而她们却无法报答他，这真<BR>
是痛苦，说不尽的痛苦。丽迪雅能够回来，能<BR>
够保全了人格，这一切都得归功于他。她一想<BR>
起自己以前竟会那样厌恶他，竟会对他那样出<BR>
言唐突，真是万分伤心！她不胜自愧，同时又<BR>
为他感到骄傲。骄傲的是，他竟会一本同情之<BR>
