<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and
looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats
there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never
occurred to her.  The certainty of meeting him had not been
checked by any of those recollections that might not
unreasonably have alarmed her.  She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the
conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting
that it was not more than might be won in the course of the
evening.  But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his
being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the
Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not
exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly
applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go
to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned;
adding, with a significant smile,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白走进尼日斐花园的会客室，在一群穿<BR>
着“红制服”的人们里面寻找韦翰先生，找来<BR>
找去都找不着，这时候她才怀疑他也许不会来<BR>
了。她本以为他一定会来，虽然想起了过去的<BR>
种种事情而颇为担心，可是她的信心并没有因<BR>
此受到影响，她比平常更小心地打扮了一番，<BR>
高高兴兴地准备要把他那颗没有被征服的心全<BR>
部征服，她相信在今天的晚会上，一定会让她<BR>
把他那颗心完全赢到手。但是过了一会儿，她<BR>
起了一种可怕的怀疑：莫不是彬格莱先生请军<BR>
官们的时候，为了讨达西先生的好，故意没有<BR>
请韦翰吗？虽然事实并非如此，不过他缺席的<BR>
原委马上就由他的朋友丹尼先生宣布了。这是<BR>
因为丽迪雅迫不及待地问丹尼，丹尼就告诉她<BR>
们说，韦翰前一天上城里有事去了，还没有回<BR>
来，又带着意味深长的微笑补充了几句：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just
now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我想，他要不是为了要回避这儿的某一位先<BR>
生，决不会就这么凑巧，偏偏这时候因事缺席<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was
caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not
less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise
had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former
was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could
hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries
which he directly afterwards approached to make. -- Attention,
forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.  She
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not
wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind
partiality provoked her.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他这个消息丽迪雅虽然没有听见，却给伊丽莎<BR>
白听见了。伊丽莎白因此断定：关于韦翰缺席<BR>
的原因，虽然她开头没有猜对，却依旧是达西<BR>
先生一手造成的。她觉得非常扫兴，对达西也<BR>
就越发起了反感，因此接下来当达西走上前来<BR>
向她问好的时候，她简直不能好声好气地回答<BR>
他。要知道，对达西殷勤，宽容，忍耐，就等<BR>
于伤害韦翰。她决定不跟他说一句话，怏怏不<BR>
乐地掉过头来就走，甚至跟彬格莱先生说起话<BR>
来也不大快乐，因为他对达西的盲目偏爱引起<BR>
了她的气愤。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every
prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not
dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to
Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon
able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her
cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.  The two
first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were
dances of mortification.  Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong
without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery
which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.
The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白天生不大会发脾气，虽然她今天晚上<BR>
大为扫兴，可是她情绪上并没有不愉快多少时<BR>
候。她先把满腔的愁苦都告诉了那位一星期没<BR>
有见面的夏绿蒂・卢卡斯小姐，过了一会儿又<BR>
自告奋勇地把她表兄奇奇怪怪的情形讲给她听<BR>
，一面又特别把他指出来给他看。头两场舞重<BR>
新使他觉得烦恼，那是两场活受罪的跳舞。柯<BR>
林斯先生又呆笨又刻板，只知道道歉，却不知<BR>
道小心一些，往往脚步弄错了自己还不知道。<BR>
他真是个十足叫人讨厌的舞伴，使她丢尽了脸<BR>
，受尽了罪。因此，从他手里解脱出来，真叫<BR>
她喜欢欲狂。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of
talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally
liked.  When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte
Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself
suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by
surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing
what she did, she accepted him.  He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of
presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她接着跟一位军官跳舞，跟他谈起韦翰的事。<BR>
听他说，韦翰是个到处讨人喜爱的人，于是她<BR>
精神上舒服了许多。跳过这几场舞以后，她就<BR>
回到夏绿蒂・卢卡斯身边，跟她谈话，这时候<BR>
突然听到达西先生叫她，出其不意地请她跳舞<BR>
，她吃了一惊，竟然不由自主地答应了他。达<BR>
西跳过以后便立刻走开了，于是她口口声声怪<BR>
自己为什么这样没主意。夏绿蒂尽力安慰她。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你将来一定会发觉他很讨人喜欢的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Heaven forbid! -- <I>That</I> would be the greatest misfortune of
all! -- To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!
-- Do not wish me such an evil."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“天不容！那才叫做倒了大的霉呢！下定决心<BR>
去恨一个人，竟会一下子又喜欢起他来！别这<BR>
样咒我吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to
claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a
whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham
to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times
his consequence.  Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place
in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in
being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in
her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began
to imagine that their silence was to last through the two
dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till
suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to
her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight
observation on the dance.  He replied, and was again silent.
After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time
with:
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">当跳舞重新开始，达西又走到她跟前来请她跳<BR>
舞的时候，夏绿蒂禁不住跟她咬了咬耳朵，提<BR>
醒她别做傻瓜，别为了对韦翰有好感，就宁可<BR>
得罪一个比韦翰的身价高上十倍的人。伊丽莎<BR>
白没有回答便下了舞池，她想不到居然会有这<BR>
样的体面，跟达西先生面对面跳舞，她看见身<BR>
旁的人们也同样露出了惊奇的目光。他们俩跳<BR>
了一会儿，一句话也没有交谈。她想象着这两<BR>
场舞可能一直要沉默到底，开头决定不要打破<BR>
这种沉默，后来突然异想天开，认为如果逼得<BR>
她的舞伴不得不说几句话，那就会叫他受更大<BR>
的罪，于是她就说了几句关于跳舞方面的话。<BR>
他回答了她的话，接着又是沉默。歇了几分钟<BR>
，她第二次跟他攀谈：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It is <I>your</I> turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. -- <I>I</I>
talked about the dance, and <I>you</I> ought to make some kind of
remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“现在该轮到你谈谈啦，达西先生。我既然谈<BR>
了跳舞，你就得谈谈舞池的大小以及有多少对<BR>
舞伴之类的问题。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say
should be said.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他笑了笑，告诉她说，她要他说什么他就说什<BR>
么。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Very well. -- That reply will do for the present. -- Perhaps
by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter
than public ones. -- But <I>now</I> we may be silent."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“好极了；这种回答眼前也说得过去了。待一<BR>
忽儿我或许会谈到私人舞会比公共场所的跳舞<BR>
会来得她；不过，我们现在可以不必作声了。<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那么说，你跳起舞来照例总得要谈上几句吗<BR>
？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Sometimes.  One must speak a little, you know.  It would look
odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet
for the advantage of <I>some</I>, conversation ought to be so
arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little
as as possible."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“有时候要的。你知道，一个人总得要说些话<BR>
。接连半个钟头待在一块儿一声不响，那是够<BR>
别扭的。不过有些人就偏偏巴不得说话愈少愈<BR>
好，为这些人着想，谈话也不妨安排得少一点<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case,
or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“在目前这样的情况下，你是在照顾你自已的<BR>
情绪呢，还是想要使我情绪上快慰？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a
great similarity in the turn of our minds. -- We are each of an
unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we
expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be
handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“一举两得，”伊丽莎白油滑地回答道。“因<BR>
为我老是感觉到我们俩转的念头很相同。你我<BR>
的性格跟人家都不大合得来，又不愿意多说话<BR>
，难得开口，除非想说几句一鸣惊人的话，让<BR>
大家当作格言来流传千古。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character,
I am sure," said he.  "How near it may be to <I>mine</I>, I cannot
pretend to say. -- <I>You</I> think it a faithful portrait
undoubtedly."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他说：“我觉得你的性格并不见得就是这样，<BR>
我的性格是否有很近似这方面，我也不敢说。<BR>
你一定觉得你自己形容得很恰当吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I must not decide on my own performance."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我当做不能自己下断语。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had
gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters
did not very often walk to Meryton.  She answered in the
affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When
you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new
acquaintance."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他没有回答，他们俩又沉默了，直等到又下池<BR>
去跳舞，他这才问她是不是常常各姐妹们上麦<BR>
里屯去溜达。她回答说常常去。她说到这里，<BR>
实在按捺不住了，便接下去说：“你那天在那<BR>
儿碰到我们的时候，我们正在结交一个新朋友<BR>
呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The effect was immediate.  A deeper shade of hauteur overspread
his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though
blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.  At
length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这句话立刻发生了效果。一阵傲慢的阴影罩上<BR>
了他的脸，可是他一句话也没有说。伊丽莎白<BR>
说不下去了，不过她心里却在埋怨自己软弱。<BR>
后来还是达西很勉强地先开口说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure
his <I>making</I> friends -- whether he may be equally capable of
<I>retaining</I> them, is less certain."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“韦翰先生生来满面春风，交起朋友来得心应<BR>
手。至于他是不是能和朋友们长久相处，那就<BR>
不大靠得住了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"He has been so unlucky as to lose <I>your</I> friendship," replied
Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to
suffer from all his life."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白加重语气回答道：“他真不幸，竟失<BR>
去了您的友谊，而且弄成那么尬的局面，可能<BR>
会使他一辈子都感受痛苦。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the
subject.  At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to
them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the
room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopt with a bow of
superior courtesy, to compliment him on his dancing and his
partner.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西没有回答，好象想换个话题。就在这当儿<BR>
，威廉・卢卡斯爵士走近他们身边，打算穿过<BR>
舞池走到屋子的寻一边去，可是一看到达西先<BR>
生，他就停住了，礼貌周全地向他鞠了一躬，<BR>
满口称赞他跳舞跳得好，舞伴又找得好。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.  Such
very superior dancing is not often seen.  It is evident that
you belong to the first circles.  Allow me to say, however,
that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must
hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a
certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing at her
sister and Bingley), shall take place.  What congratulations
will then flow in!  I appeal to Mr. Darcy: -- but let me not
interrupt you, Sir. -- You will not thank me for detaining you
from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright
eyes are also upbraiding me."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我真太高兴了，亲爱的先生，跳得这样一手<BR>
好舞，真是少见。你毫无问题是属于第一流的<BR>
人材。让我再唠叨一句，你这位漂亮的舞伴也<BR>

是将来有一天某一桩好事如愿的时候，亲爱的<BR>
伊丽莎白小姐。”（他朝着她的姐姐和彬格莱<BR>
望了一眼）“那时候将会有臬热闹的祝贺场面<BR>
啊。我要求达西先生：──可是我还是别打搅<BR>
你吧，先生。你正在和这位小姐谈得心醉神迷<BR>

那了双明亮的眼睛也在责备我呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The latter part of this address was scarcely, heard by Darcy;
but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him
forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious
expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,
and said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">后半段话达西几乎没有听见。可是威廉爵士提<BR>
起他那位朋友，却不免叫他心头大受震动，于<BR>
是他一本正经去望着那正在跳舞的彬格莱和吉<BR>

talking of."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I do not think we were speaking at all.  Sir William could
not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less
to say for themselves. -- We have tried two or three subjects
already without success, and what we are to talk of next I
cannot imagine."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我觉得我们根本就没有谈什么。这屋子里随<BR>

her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.

Wickham! -- Your sister has been talking to me about him, and
asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man
forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was
the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.  Let me
recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit
confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using
him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has
been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
treated Mr. Darcy, in a most infamous manner.  I do not know
the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in
the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham
mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well
avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was
excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the
way.  His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent
thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favorite's
guilt; but really, considering his descent one could not expect
much better."

who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of
Bingley.  Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency,

Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment

will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his
friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has
deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as
his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young
man.  I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved
to lose Mr. Darcy's regard."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白激动地说：“彬格莱先生当然是个诚<BR>

each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest
hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all
in her power to heighten her confidence in it.  On their being
joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss
Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up
to them and told her with great exultation that he had just
been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.

cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.  How
wonderfully these sort of things occur!  Who would have thought
of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly! -- I am most thankful that the
discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him,

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme;
assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing
him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather
than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least
necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that
if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. -- Mr. Collins listened
to her with the determined air of following his own inclination
and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白竭力劝他不要那么做，她说，他如果<BR>

通候。柯林斯先生听她这么说，便显出一副坚<BR>

等她说完了，他回答道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the
world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the
scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there
must be a wide difference between the established forms of
ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the
clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the
clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest
rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained.  You must therefore
allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this
occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point
of duty.  Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice,
which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a
young lady like yourself."  And with a low bow he left her to
attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly
watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very
evident.  Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and
though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing
it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh." -- It vexed her to
see him expose himself to such a man.  Mr. Darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed
him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.
Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again,
and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the
length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made
him a slight bow, and moved another way.  Mr. Collins then
returned to Elizabeth.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue,
she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and
Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her
observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as
Jane.  She saw her, in idea, settled in that very house, in all
the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow;
and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
even to like Bingley's two sisters.  Her mother's thoughts she
plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.  When they sat
down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky
perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and
deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to
that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing
else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to
Mr. Bingley. -- It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match.  His being such a charming young man, and so rich,
and living but three miles from them, were the first points of
self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how
fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they
must desire the connection as much as she could do.  It was,
moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as
Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other
rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to
be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their
sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more
than she liked.  It was necessary to make this circumstance a
matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the
etiquette but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find
comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.  She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be
equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing
there was no chance of it.

preparing to oblige the company.  By many significant looks and
silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance, -- but in vain; Mary would not understand them;
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and
she began her song.  Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with
most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through
the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill
rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the
thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a
minute began another.  Mary's powers were by no means fitted
for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner
affected. -- Elizabeth was in agonies.  She looked at Jane, to
see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to
Bingley.  She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued
however impenetrably grave.  She looked at her father to
entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all
night.  He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second
song, said aloud,

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to
sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the
company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent
diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a
clergyman. -- I do not mean however to assert that we can be
justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there
are certainly other things to be attended to.  The rector of a
parish has much to do. -- In the first place, he must make such
an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.  He must write his own sermons; and
the time that remains will not be too much for his parish
duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he
cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.  And
I do not think it of light importance that he should have
attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body,
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.
I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of
the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect
towards any body connected with the family."  And with a bow to
Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so
loud as to be heard by half the room. -- Many stared. -- Many
smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself,
while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady
Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.

to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening,
it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with
more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for
Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped
his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much
distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.  That his
two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an
opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she
could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more
intolerable.

teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her
side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with
him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.  In
vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and
offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.  He
assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to
it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to
recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a
point of remaining close to her the whole evening.  There was
no arguing upon such a project.  She owed her greatest relief
to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.

carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone,
which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away
by some of the family.  Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely
opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were
evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.  They
repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by
so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very
little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was
complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of
their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which
had marked their behaviour to their guests.  Darcy said nothing
at all.  Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached
from the rest, and talked only to each other.  Elizabeth
preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss
Bingley; and even Lydia was to much fatigued to utter more than
the occasional exclamation of "Lord how tired I am!"
