This grammatical structure is roughly  equivalent to the English "I think ..." or "It seems like ..." This structure is used in conjunction  with descriptive verbs and the copula 이다 (ida).  -----------------------------  ▷ Construction  KOREANCLASS101.COM                                                  INTERMEDIATE #1 - WHAT AM I TO DO? 9 ----------------------- Page 10-----------------------
-----------------------------  (a) Descriptive Verb Stem ending in a consonant + 은 것 같다 (b) Descriptive Verb Stem ending in a vowel +  ㄴ 것 같다  For example: (a) 좋다  An example of indirectness. (a) 비싸다 - it's expensive (b) 비싼 것 같다 - I think it's expensive.  In this specific example, example (a) is quite direct, whereas example (b) is a bit more  indirect. Therefore it's softer language, and more appreciated.  -----------------------------  ▷ In This Dialog  -----------------------------  (6)성민: 몰라요. 기분이 안 좋은 것 같아요. (6)Seongmin : mollayo. gibun-i an joheun geot gatayo. (6)Seongmin: I don't know. I don't think she's feeling to well.  ---------------------------  ♣ More Examples ♣  ---------------------------  1.아저씨 집은 바싼 것 같에요.  (ajeossi jip-eun bissan geot gat-eyo.)  Mister, your house seems to be expensive.  2.성민은 수집어 한 것 같에.  (seongmin-eun sujibeo han geot gat-e)  KOREANCLASS101.COM                                                            INTERMEDIATE #1 - WHAT AM I TO DO? 10 ----------------------- Page 11-----------------------
Seongmin seems to be shy.  3.현철은 바쁜 것 같다.  (hyeoncheol-eun bappeun geot gatta).  HyeonCheol seems to be busy.  (Negation)  4.오스틴은 아픈 것 같지 않다.  (oseutin-eun apeun geot gatchi  Austin does not seem to be hurt.  5.오스틴은 아프지 않은 것 같다.  Austin seems like he is not hurt.  ------------------------  ☞ remember ☜  ------------------------  The resulting ending (같다) can be conjugated according to politeness level or tense, just like  any verb.  같다 (gatta) is an independent word, which expresses “to be like,” and “to be similar.”  The negation (-지 않다) can be expressed in both the final verb (같다) or the main verb with – ㄴ (은).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Grammar Point #2 - but, however, so -  ㄴ/는데 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  - ㄴ/는데 is a grammatical structure, which can be translated in several different ways,  according to circumstances. It can be translated as "and," "but," however," or "so." It can be  used as a sentence ending, or a non-final ending. As the translation suggests, it is used when  one wishes to introduce another sentence.  -----------------------------  KOREANCLASS101.COM                                                             INTERMEDIATE #1 - WHAT AM I TO DO? 11 ----------------------- Page 12-----------------------
▷ Construction  -----------------------------  (a) -는데 is added to a verb stem.  (b) - ㄴ데 to a descriptive verb stem that ends in a vowel, (c) -은데 to a descriptive verb stem that ends in a consonant.  Example: (a) 한국어를 공부한다 + 그런데 = 한국어를 공부하는데  (b) 키가 크다 + 그런데 = 키가 큰데 (c) 키가 작다 + 그런데 = 키가 작은데  But the verb 이다 becomes '인데'  Example: 나는 학생이다 + 그런데 ... = 나는 학생인데, ...  -----------------------------  ▷ In This Dialog  -----------------------------  (10)소연: 엄마.... 나 오늘 지갑 잃어 버렸어요. 그 안에 중요한 물건 다 있는데... 나 어떡해요... (10)Soyeon : eomma... na oneul jigap ilheo beoryeosseoyo. geu an-e jungyohan mulgeon da  itneunde... na eotteokhaeyo... (10)Soyeon: (waa) Mom... I lost my wallet today. All my important things were in there... What  am I supposed to do...  ---------------------------  ♣ More Examples ♣  ---------------------------  저는 이 학교 다녔는데, 별로 좋아하지 않았어요. I attended this school, but I didn't particularly like it.  KOREANCLASS101.COM                                                          INTERMEDIATE #1 - WHAT AM I TO DO? 12 ----------------------- Page 13-----------------------
저는 이 학교 다녔는데 (I attended this school, but) - this sentence is an introduction to the main  clause: 별로 좋아하지 않았어요. (I didn't particularly like it.)  오늘 추운데, 모자 써. It's cold today, so wear a hat.  오늘 추운데 (It's cold today so,) - this sentence is an introduction to the main clause: 모자 써.  (wear a hat.)  If this structure is used as a sentence ending, then it is implying another idea after that. Here  are a few examples:  나 오늘 바쁜데. (못 만나.) I'm busy today so. (I can't meet.)  여기 밥 많이 안 주는데. (다른 데 가자.) They don't give a lot of food here so. (let's go somewhere else.)  These must be inferred from context.  ------------------------  ☞ remember ☜  ------------------------  This grammatical structure originally comes from "-다 + 그런데", and 그런데 means 'but' or  'however'. Therefore, -은데 or -는데 means "...., but". But -는/는데 can also mean that something  is expected after this. You can hear a lot of sentences in Korean finishing with -는/는데, and  this mean the speaker is indicating a different idea or another possibility, or it can be a signal  for feedback. ("맛있는데." can mean "It is delicious but..." but it can also mean "I think it's  delicious, and what do you think?")  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Grammar Point #3 - Doing Something Unintentionally - 버리다 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The verb 버리다 originally means "to throw away", but when it is combined with another verb  stem that precedes it, it means "to do something that wasn't intended" or "to do something  KOREANCLASS101.COM                                                            INTERMEDIATE #1 - WHAT AM I TO DO? 13 ----------------------- Page 14-----------------------
completely, or totally".  (a) 말해 버리다. = to ending up saying something that should not have been said (b) 가 버리다. = to go away completely (c) 나는 그 책을 사 버렸다. = I didn't mean to, but I ended up buying that book. (d) 그는 나를 잊어 버렸다. = He has completely forgotten about me.  (e) 누군가가 나를 봐 버렸다. = Somebody saw me, although I was hoping that nobody would.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Grammar Point #4 - What Am I to Do? - 어떡해 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This phrase is used in times of distress when one does not know what to do. This phrase is  used more often by females than males. This phrase, 어떡해 comes from '어떻게 해', which  means 'What should I do? or What am I supposed to do?'  CULTURAL INSIGHT If you drop or forget something in the subway or on a bus in Korea, chances are rare that it  would go unnoticed by anyone before it reaches the end of the bus/subway route. But if it  does end up being found by the driver of the bus/subway train, you can call the bus/subway  companies and ask if they have your lost item in their lost and found center. But in case  someone picks it up and gives you a phone call, it is stated in the law the founder can ask the  owner for a compensation of 5~20% of the item's worth. But the usual rate that people give  and take is around 10% of the item's worth (or if it's your wallet that you had lost, the amount  of money that you had in the wallet.)  And if you've picked up somebody's wallet and you don't know how to return it to the person,  you can just put it into a nearest postbox, and the postman will safely deliver it to the owner.  KOREANCLASS101.COM                                                          INTERMEDIATE #1 - WHAT AM I TO DO? 14
