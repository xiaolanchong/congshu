Daily Life - New Guy in Town (C0011)  A:    Oh, I don’t know if you heard, but someone moved        into that old house down the road.  B:   Yeah, I know.      I met the owner of the house yes-       terday as he was moving in. His name is Armand.  A:    Really? What’s he like? You have to ﬁll me in.  B:   Actually, he’s a bit strange. I don’t know... I’ve got        a bad feeling about him.  A:    Really? Why?  B:   Well,  yesterday  I  brought  over  a  housewarming       gift,  but  Armand  started  acting  really  weird,  and       then he practically kicked me out! I tried to, sort of,        peek into his house,  but everything was so dark        inside that I couldn’t really get a good look.  A:    Well,   you’ll  never  guess  what  I  saw  this  morn-        ing.  A delivery truck pulled into his driveway, and        it  dropped  off  a  long,  rectangular  box.        It  almost        looked like a cofﬁn!  B:    You see! Why would he...  C:    Hello ladies...  B:    Ah, Armand! You scared the heck out of me! This        is my friend Doris.  C:    A pleasure to meet you...If you are not doing any-        thing tonight, I would like to have you both for din-        ner. I mean...I would like to have you both over for        dinner. Key Vocabulary   I don’t know if          phrase             phrase  used   to  intro-  you heard                                    duce a piece of informa-                                               tion  ﬁll me in                  phrase              tell me about it   a bad feeling             phrase              a  sense  or  feeling  that                                                 something  bad  is  going                                                 to happen  weird                      Adjective           strange, unusual   kick out                  principle           make  or  force  someone                             verb,    past       leave  when   they   don’t                             simple              want to   creep me out              phrase              make    me   feel uncom-                                                 fortable    and    a   bit                                                 scared  you’ll      never          phrase              phrase   used   to  intro-   guess                                         duce a piece of news   scare          the        phrase              cause someone to feel a   heck     out     of                           lot of fear   me Supplementary Vocabulary   bizarre                   Adjective           strange or unusual   creepy                    Adjective           strange  or  scary,  caus-                                                 ing  people  to  feel  ner-                                                 vous and afraid  vampire                      common              a   dead    person     who                              noun,     sin-       drinks the blood of liv-                              gular                ing people   have           you         phrase               phrase    used   to  intro-   heard                                           duce a piece of gossip   guess what                 phrase               phrase    used   to  intro-                                                   duce   an  interesting   or                                                   surprising   piece   of in-                                                   formation
