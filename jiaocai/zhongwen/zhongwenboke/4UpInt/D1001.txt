Upper-Intermediate - Getting a Driver's License

(D1001)

A

早！今天你老公送你来的？

zǎo! jīntiān nǐ lǎogōng sòng nǐ lái de?

Morning!  Did your husband drive you to work today?

B

是啊，他刚拿到驾照，非要送我。

shì a, tā gāng nádào jiàzhào, fēi yào  sòng wǒ.

Yeah, he just got his driver's license, so he insisted on driving me.

A

老外办上海驾照挺难的吧？我就是怕麻烦，一直没让我老公去办。

lǎowài bàn Shànghǎi jiàzhào tǐng nán de ba? wǒ jiùshì pà máfan, yīzhí méi ràng wǒ lǎogōng qù bàn.

Is it very difficult for a foreigner to get his driver's license?  I really hate hassles, so I never let my husband go get his.

B

我们以前也是怕麻烦，结果出个门都得我开车，所以前些天就硬着头皮去办了，没想到还挺容易的。

wǒmen yǐqián yě shì pà máfan, jiéguǒ chū ge mén dōu děi wǒ kāichē, suǒyǐ qiánxiētiān jiù yìng zhe tóupí qù bàn le, méixiǎngdào hái tǐng róngyì de.

Before, we also thought it was going to be a big pain, so every time we went out, I was the one that had to drive.  So a few days ago we bit the bullet and went to do it.  We didn't realize that it would actually be so easy.

A

哎，那快教教我，都要准备些什么？

āi, nà kuài jiāo jiao wǒ, dōu yào zhǔnbèi xiē shénme?

Wow!  OK, then you have to give me the low down--what do we need to prepare?

B

你老公本来有驾照的吧？

nǐ lǎogong běnlái yǒu jiàzhào de ba?

Does your husband already have a driver's license?

A

有的，他十几岁就开始开车了。

yǒu de, tā shíjǐ suì jiù kāishǐ kāichē le.

Yes, he started driving when he was a teenager.

B

那就只要带护照，居留证明，和他自己国家的驾照，去车管所办一下境外换证就行了。一定要本人去的，不能代办。

nà jiù zhǐyào dài hùzhào, jūliúzhèngmíng, hé tā zìjǐ guójiā de jiàzhào, qù chēguǎnsuǒ bàn yīxià jìngwàihuànzhèng jiù xíng le. yīdìng yào běnrén qù de, bùnéng dàibàn.

Then he just needs to bring his passport, residence permit and his driver's license from his home country and go to the Department of Motor Vehicles to change it to a local permit.  But he has to go in person, you can't do it on his behalf.

A

哦，反正我得跟他一起去。

ō, fǎnzhèng wǒ děi gēn tā yīqǐ qù.

Oh, well, I should go with him, anyway.

B

到了车管所以后警察会验证件，让你填一张申请表，完了就去拍照和体检。对了，证件要原件和复印件。还有，驾照要翻译成中文。

dào le chēguǎnsuǒ yǐhòu jǐngchá huì yàn zhèngjiàn, ràng nǐ tián yī zhāng shēnqǐngbiǎo, wán le jiù qù pāizhào hé tǐjiǎn. duì le, zhèngjiàn yào yuánjiàn hé fùyìnjiàn. háiyǒu, jiàzhào yào fānyì chéng Zhōngwén.

When you get to the motor vehicle branch the police will verify your documents, and have you fill out an application form.  Oh right, you need the original and a photocopy of the documents.  Also, you need to get your driver's license translated into Chinese.

A

要去指定地点翻译吗？

yào qù zhǐdìng dìdiǎn fānyì ma?

Do you have to go to some kind of designated translator to get it translated?

B

英文的车管所有人翻译，其它的要去指定地点翻译。

Yīngwén de chēguǎnsuǒ yǒu rén  fānyì, qítā de yào qù zhǐdìng dìdiǎn fānyì.

The Department of Motor Vehicles will have someone to translate English licenses. If it's in a different language, you have to go to a designated translation agency.

A

在别的地方拍照和体检可以吗？

zài biéde dìfang pāizhào hé tǐjiǎn kěyǐ ma?

Is it possible to use a photos and a health exam that you got somewhere else?

B

最好到车管所去做吧，不符合要求的话还得重来，多麻烦。

zuìhǎo dào chēguǎnsuǒ qù zuò ba, bù fúhé yāoqiú dehuà hái děi chóng lái, duō máfan.

It would probably be best to get those at the Department of Motor Vehicles. If the ones you provide are not acceptable, you have to go again, which is a big hassle.

A

有道理。那什么时候考试？

yǒu dàolǐ. nà shénme shíhou kǎoshì?

Right. So when will he take the test?

B

一般是一星期以后考交规，驾龄不满3年的话还要考路考。

yībān shì yī xīngqī yǐhòu kǎo jiāoguī, jiàlíng bù mǎn sān nián dehuà hái yào kǎo lùkǎo.

Generally, you take the traffic rules test a week later. People with less than three years' driving experience also need to take a road test.

A

交规好考吗？不会是用中文考吧？

jiāoguī hǎokǎo ma? bùhuì shì yòng Zhōngwén kǎo ba?

Is the traffic rules test really tricky? Please tell me the test isn't in Chinese...

B

得准备准备，不过有外文版的参考书。有100道题，要做对90道才能通过。

děi zhǔnbèizhǔnbèi bùguò yǒu wàiwénbǎn  de cānkǎoshū. yǒu yībǎi dào tí, yào zuò duì jiǔshí dào cái néng tōngguò.

You have to prepare for it. But you can take it in languages besides Chinese. You have to get 90 out of 100 questions right to pass.

A

那通过以后，多长时间可以拿到驾照？

nà tōngguò yǐhòu, duōcháng shíjiān kěyǐ nádào jiàzhào?

So after he takes the test, how long before he can get the license?

B

考完试当天就能拿到了。

kǎo wán shì dàngtiān jiù néng nádào le.

You get the license the same day, after finishing the test.

A

哦！谢谢你啊！我们改天也去办！

ō! xièxie nǐ a! wǒmen gǎitiān yě qù bàn!

Whoa! Thanks a lot! We'll go someday soon!

B

不客气！希望你们也办得顺利！

bù kèqi! xīwàng nǐmen yě bàn de shùnlì!

No problem! Hope it goes well for you!
