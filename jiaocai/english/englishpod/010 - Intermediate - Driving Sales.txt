The Ofﬁce - Driving Sales  (C0010)  A:   All  right,  people.   We’re  holding  this  meeting  to-       day because we’ve got to do something about our       sales, and we need to do it NOW! I want concrete       solutions.     How  do  you  intend  to  drive  sales...        Roger?  B:   Well, in fact, we’re the most expensive in the mar-       ket,  so  maybe  we  need  to  lower  our  prices  to        match the competitors?  A:    Lower our prices?  Not very creative.  It’ll never ﬂy       with Swan.     What kind of thinking is that?        Geez.       Anybody else have a better plan? Natalie?  C:    Um,  perhaps,  um,  a  sales  promotion.         Maybe  a       two-for-one offer, or something like that!  A:   What?     That’s the same thing.       Bad idea.     Really       bad idea.     Dammit people come on!           Think!   The       CEO will be here any minute.  D:    Do we have any ideas yet?  C:    Yes Mr. Swan, we were kind of considering a two-        for-one offer to get more competitive.  D:    A two-for-one promotion?  Hmm.  I kind of like the        sound of that. It sounds like something we should        consider.  A:    Yeah,  exactly.     Just  what  I  was  thinking!      In  fact,        that’s a brilliant idea!  I’m glad we thought of that.        Very creative.
