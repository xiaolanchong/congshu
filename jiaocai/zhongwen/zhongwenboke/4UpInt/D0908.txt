A

同学们，今天我们要讲的是一位革命家。他领导辛亥革命，推翻满清政府。知道他是谁吗？

tóngxué men, jīntiān wǒmen yào jiǎng de shì yī wèi gémìngjiā. tā lǐngdǎo Xīnhài gémìng, tuīfān Mǎnqīng zhèngfǔ. zhīdào tā shì shéi ma?

Students, today we want to talk about a revolutionary.  He led the 1911 Revolution, overthrowing the Manchurian government.  Do you know who he is?

B

是孙中山。

shì Sūnzhōngshān.

It was Sun Yatsen.

A

嗯，陈磊说得对。孙中山是中国民主革命的先行者。他建立了中华民国，也是中国国民党的创党人之一。

ng4, Chén Lěi shuō de duì. Sūn Zhōngshān shì Zhōngguó mínzhǔ gémìng de xiānxíngzhě. tā jiànlì le Zhōnghuámínguó, yě shì Zhōngguó Guómíndǎng de chuàngdǎngrén zhīyī.

Uh-huh, Chen Lei is correct.  Sun Yatsen was the forerunner of the Chinese democratic revolution.  He is also one of the founders of the Chinese Nationalist Party.

C

老师，他好像有好多名字。

lǎoshī, tā hǎoxiàng yǒu hǎo duō míngzi.

Teacher, doesn't he have a whole bunch of names?

A

对，他号逸仙，以前还用过孙文。

duì, tā hào Yìxiān, yǐqián hái yòng guo Sūnwén.

Yes, his name was "Yi Xian," before that he also went by "Sun Wen."

D

许多外国人知道的都是孙逸仙这个名字。

xǔduō wàiguórén zhīdào de dōu shì Sūn Yìxiān zhè ge míngzi.

The name a lot of foreigners know him by is Sun Yatsen.

C

徐晓婷，你真有国际视角。

Xú Xiǎotíng, nǐ zhēn yǒu guójì shìjiǎo.

Xu Xiaoting, you really have a global perspective.

A

林峰说国际视角，其实孙中山正是有国际视角的革命家。他在不同的国家学习、生活过，思想开明。大家现在把书翻到第二十页。陈磊，读一下孙中山提出的三民主义。

Lín Fēng shuō guójì shìjiǎo, qíshí Sūn Zhōngshān zhèngshì yǒu guójì shìjiǎo de gémìngjiā. tā zài bùtóng de guójiā xuéxí, shēnghuó guo, sīxiǎng kāimíng. dàjiā xiànzài bǎ shū fān dào dì èrshí yè. Chén Lěi, dú yīxià Sūn Zhōngshān tíchū de Sānmínzhǔyì.

Lin Feng calls it a global perspective, actually Sun Yatsen was a revolutionary with a global perspective.  He was educated in and had lived in different countries, so he was very open-minded.  Everyone, take your books and turn to page twenty.  Chen Lei, read for us the Three People's Principles as set out by Sun Yatsen.

B

三民主义指的是民族主义、民权主义和民生主义。它是中国人民宝贵的精神遗产。

Sānmínzhǔyì zhǐ de shì mínzú zhǔyì, mínquán zhǔyì hé mínshēng zhǔyì. tā shì Zhōngguó rénmín bǎoguì de jīngshén yíchǎn.

The three people's principles are nationalism, democracy, and livelihood.  They are a precious part of the legacy of the spirit of the Chinese people.

C

哇，孙中山长得真严肃，一看就是忧国忧民的人。

wā, Sūn Zhōngshān zhǎng de zhēn yánsù, yī kàn jiùshì yōuguóyōumín de rén.

Wow, Sun Yatsen looks really solemn.  As soon as you look at him you can tell he was a person who was very concerned about his nation and its people.

D

他确实很担心国家和人民的命运。他的遗言是“革命尚未成功，同志仍须努力”。

tā quèshí hěn dānxīn guójiā hé rénmín de mìngyùn. tā de yíyán shì"gémìng shàng wèi chénggōng, tóngzhì réng xū nǔlì".

He certainly was very concerned with the destiny of his country and people.  His last words before he died were 'The revolution has not yet succeeded. Comrades, we must still make great efforts.'

A

对，因为辛亥革命并没有取得彻底的胜利。下节课我们会继续说。

duì, yīnwèi Xīnhài gémìng bìng méiyǒu qǔdé chèdǐ de shènglì. xià jié kè wǒmen huì jìxù shuō.

Yes, because the 1911 Revolution had not yet attained victory.  We'll talk more about that next class.
