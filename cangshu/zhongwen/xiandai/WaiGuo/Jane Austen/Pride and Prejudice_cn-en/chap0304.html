letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this
disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that
had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was
over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters
from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been
missent elsewhere.  Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of
alarming you -- be assured that we are all well.  What I have
to say relates to poor Lydia.  An express came at twelve last
night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster,
to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his
officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! -- Imagine our
surprise.  To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly
unexpected.  I am very, very sorry.  So imprudent a match on
both sides! -- But I am willing to hope the best, and that his
character has been misunderstood.  Thoughtless and indiscreet I
can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over
it) marks nothing bad at heart.  His choice is disinterested at
least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.  Our
poor mother is sadly grieved.  My father bears it better.  How
thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said
against him; we must forget it ourselves.  They were off
Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not
missed till yesterday morning at eight.  The express was sent
off directly.  My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten
miles of us.  Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him
here soon.  Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her
of their intention.  I must conclude, for I cannot be long from
my poor mother.  I am afraid you will not be able to make it
out, but I hardly know what I have written."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">亲爱的丽萃，写了上半封信之后，发生了一件<BR>
极其出人意料、极其严重的事；可是我又怕吓<BR>
坏了你。请放心吧，家里人都好，我这里要说<BR>
的是关于可怜的丽迪雅的事。昨天晚上十二点<BR>
钟，我们正要睡觉和时候，突然接到弗斯脱上<BR>
校一封快信，告诉我们说，丽迪雅跟他部下的<BR>
一个军官到苏格兰去了；老实说，就是跟韦翰<BR>
私奔了！你想象我们当时多么惊奇。不过吉蒂<BR>
却以为这件事并非完全出人意料。我真难受。<BR>
这两个男女就这样冒冒失失地配成了一对！可<BR>
是我还是愿意从最好的方面去着想，希望别人<BR>
都是误解了他的人品。我固然认为他为人轻率<BR>
冒昧，不过他这次的举动未必就是存心不良（<BR>
让我们但愿如此吧）。至少他选中这个对象不<BR>
是为了有利可图，因为他一定知道父亲没有一<BR>
个钱给她。可怜的母亲伤心得要命。父亲总算<BR>
还支持得住。谢天谢地，好在我们从来没有让<BR>
他们老人家知道外界对他的议论。我们自己也<BR>
不必把它放在心上。据大家猜想，他们大概是<BR>
星期六晚上十二点钟走的，但是一直到昨天早<BR>
上八点钟，才发现这两个失了踪。于是弗斯脱<BR>
上校连忙写信告诉我们。亲爱的丽萃，他们所<BR>
经过的地方离开我们一定不满十英里。弗斯脱<BR>
上校说，他一定立刻就到我们这里来。丽迪雅<BR>
留了一封短信给弗斯脱太太，把他们两人的意<BR>

开母亲太久。我怕你一定觉得莫明其妙吧，我<BR>
自己也简直不知道在写些什么。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely
knowing what she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter,
instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost
impatience, read as follows -- it had been written a day later
than the conclusion of the first:
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白读完了这封信以后，几乎说不出自己<BR>
是怎样的感觉，想也没有想一下，便连忙抓起<BR>
另一封信，迫不及待一拆开就看。这封信比第<BR>
一封信迟写一天。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot
answer for being coherent.  Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what
I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be
delayed.  Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our
poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are
not gone to Scotland.  Colonel Forster came yesterday, having
left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.
Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand
that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by
Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there,
or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F.,
who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to
trace their route.  He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no
farther; for on entering that place they removed into a
hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from
Epsom.  All that is known after this is that they were seen to
continue the London road.  I know not what to think.  After
making every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel
F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all
the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but
without any success; no such people had been seen to pass
through.  With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and
broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to
his heart.  I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no
one can throw any blame on them.  Our distress, my dear Lizzy,
is very great.  My father and mother believe the worst, but I
cannot think so ill of him.  Many circumstances might make it
more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
pursue their first plan; and even if <I>he</I> could form such a
design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is
not likely, can I suppose her so lost to every thing? --
Impossible.  I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not
disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when
I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be
trusted.  My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room.
Could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to
be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so
affected.  Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their
attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot
wonder.  I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been
spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the
first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?
I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if
inconvenient.  Adieu.  I take up my pen again to do what I have
just told you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I
cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as
possible.  I know my dear uncle and aunt so well that I am not
afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to
ask of the former.  My father is going to London with Colonel
Forster instantly, to try to discover her.  What he means to
do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not
allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and
Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow
evening.  In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance
would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">亲爱的妹妹，你现在大概收到了我那封匆促草<BR>
成的信了吧。我希望这封信会把问题说得明白<BR>
些；不过，时间虽然并不是急促，我的头脑却<BR>
糊里糊涂，因此并不是担保这封信一定会写得<BR>
有条有理。我的亲丽萃，我简直不知道该写些<BR>
什么，但是我总得把坏消息报道给你，而且事<BR>
不宜迟。尽管韦翰先生和我们可怜的丽迪雅的<BR>
婚姻是多么荒唐，可是我们却巴不得听到他们<BR>
已经结婚的消息，因为我们非常担心他们并没<BR>
有到苏格兰去。弗斯脱上校前天寄也那封快信<BR>
以后，稍隔数小时即由白利屯出发到我们这儿<BR>
来，已于昨日抵达此间。虽然丽迪雅给弗太太<BR>
的那封短信里说，他们俩要到格利那草场去，<BR>
可是根据丹呢透露出来的口风，他相信韦决不<BR>
打算到那儿去，也根本不打算跟丽迪雅结婚。<BR>
弗上校一听此话，大为骇异，便连忙从白出发<BR>
，希望能追到他们。他一路追踪觅迹，追到克<BR>
拉普汗，这倒还不费什么事，可是再往前追便<BR>
不容易，因为他们两人到达此地后，便把从艾<BR>
普桑雇来的马车打发走了，重新雇了出租马车<BR>
。以后的先踪去迹便颇难打听，只听见有人说<BR>
，看见他们继续往伦敦那方面去。我不知道应<BR>
该怎样想法。弗上校在伦敦竭力仔细打听了一<BR>
番以后，便来到哈福德郡，在沿路的关卡上以<BR>
及巴纳特和帽场两地所有的旅馆里，统统探寻<BR>
了一遍，可是不得要领而返。大家都说没有看<BR>
见这样的人走过。他无限关切地来到了浪搏恩<BR>
，把他的种种疑虑全都诚心诚意地告诉了我们<BR>
。我实在替他和弗太太难过；谁也不能怪他们<BR>
夫妇俩亲爱的丽萃，我们真是痛苦到极点。父<BR>
亲和母亲都以为，这事情的下场势必糟透坏极<BR>
，可是我却不忍心把他看作那么坏。也许为了<BR>
种种关系，他们觉得在城里私下结婚，比较合<BR>
适，故未按照原来计划进行；纵使他欺侮丽迪<BR>
雅年幼无知，没有显亲贵戚，因而对她存心不<BR>
良，难道丽迪雅自己也会不顾一切吗？这件事<BR>
绝对不可能！不过，听到弗上校不大相信他们<BR>
俩会结婚，我又不免伤心。我把我的心愿说给<BR>
他听，他只是频频摇头，又说韦恐怕是个靠不<BR>
住的人。可怜的妈真要病倒了，整天不出房门<BR>
。要是她能勉强克制一下，事情也许要好些，<BR>
可惜她无法办到。讲到父亲，我一辈子也没见<BR>
过他这样难受。可怜的吉蒂也很气愤，她怪她<BR>
自己没有把他们俩的亲密关系预先告诉家里；<BR>
但是他们俩既然信任她能够保守秘密，我也不<BR>
便怪她没有早讲。最亲爱的丽萃，我真替你高<BR>
兴，这些痛苦的场面对你说来，真是眼不见为<BR>
净。不过，开头一场惊险既已过去，我很希望<BR>
你回来，你不会觉得我这是不合情理吧？如果<BR>
你不方便，自然我也不会太自私，非要逼你回<BR>
来不可。再见吧！刚刚才告诉过你，我不愿意<BR>
逼你回来，现在我又要拿起笔来逼你了，因为<BR>
照目前情况看来，我不得不诚恳地请求你们尽<BR>
可能快些回来。舅父母和我相知颇深，决不会<BR>
见怪，我因此才大胆提出要求，而且我还有别<BR>
的事要求舅父帮忙。父亲马上就要跟弗斯脱上<BR>
校到伦敦去想办法找她。他的具体打算我无从<BR>
知道，可是看他那么痛苦万状，就知道他办起<BR>
事来决不会十分稳妥，而弗斯脱上校明天晚上<BR>
就得回白利屯。情况如此紧急，万万非请舅父<BR>
前来协助指示不可。我相信他一定会体谅我此<BR>
刻的心情，我相信他一定肯来帮忙。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting
from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to
follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious;
but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and
Mr. Darcy appeared.  Her pale face and impetuous manner made
him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's
situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must
leave you.  I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business
that cannot be delayed; I have not a moment to lose."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白读完信以后，不禁失声叫道：“舅父<BR>
上哪儿去啦？”她连忙从椅子上跳起来急急去<BR>
找寻舅父。时间太宝贵，一分钟也不能错过。<BR>
她刚走到门口，恰逢佣人把门打开，达西先生<BR>
走了进来。他看见她脸色苍白，神情仓皇，不<BR>
由得吃了一惊。他还没有定下心来说一句话，<BR>
她却因为一心只想到丽迪雅的处境，却连忙叫<BR>
起来了：“对不起，不能奉陪。我有紧要的事<BR>
要去找嘉丁纳先生，一分钟也不能耽搁。”<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Good God!  what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling
than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain
you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and
Mrs. Gardiner.  You are not well enough; -- you cannot go
yourself."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他抑制不住一时的感情冲动，便也顾不得礼貌<BR>

”他让自己定了一下心，然后接下去说：“我<BR>

嘉丁纳先生夫妇吧，或是让佣人去也好。你身<BR>
体不好；你不能去。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and
she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to
pursue them.  Calling back the servant, therefore, she
commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made
her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress
home instantly.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白犹豫不定，但是她已经双膝发抖，也<BR>
觉得自己没有办法去找他们。她只得叫佣人来<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support
herself, and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible
for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of
gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid.  Is there
nothing you could take, to give you present relief? -- A glass
of wine; -- shall I get you one? -- You are very ill."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">佣人走出去以后，她便坐下来，达西见她身体<BR>

你好象有病呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover
herself.  "There is nothing the matter with me.  I am quite
well.  I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have
just received from Longbourn."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她竭力保持镇静，回答他道：“不要，谢谢你<BR>

来了一个不幸的消息，使我很难受。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few
minutes could not speak another word.  Darcy, in wretched
suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern,
and observe her in compassionate silence.  At length, she spoke
again.  "I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful
news.  It cannot be concealed from any one.  My youngest sister
has left all her friends -- has eloped; -- has thrown herself
into the power of -- of Mr. Wickham.  They are gone off
together from Brighton.  <I>You</I> know him too well to doubt the
rest.  She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt
him to -- she is lost for ever."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她说到这里，不禁哭了起来，半天说不出一句<BR>
话。达西一时摸不着头脑，只得含含糊糊说了<BR>
些慰问的话，默默无言地望着她，心里很是同<BR>

英一封信，告诉我一个非常不幸的消息，反正<BR>
这也瞒不住任何人。告诉你，我那最小的妹妹<BR>
丢了她所有的亲友──私奔了──落入了韦翰<BR>
先生的圈套。他们俩是从白利屯逃走的。你深<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Darcy was fixed in astonishment.  "When I consider," she added,
in a yet more agitated voice, "that <I>I</I> might have prevented
it! -- <I>I</I> who knew what he was.  Had I but explained some part
of it only -- some part of what I learnt -- to my own family!
Had his character been known, this could not have happened.
But it is all, all too late now."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西给吓呆了。伊丽莎白又用一种更激动的声<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Darcy made no answer.  He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was
walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow
contracted, his air gloomy.  Elizabeth soon observed and
instantly understood it.  Her power was sinking; every thing
<I>must</I> sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an
assurance of the deepest disgrace.  She should neither wonder
nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought
nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her
distress.  It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make
her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly
felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must
be vain.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西没有回答。他好象完全没有听到她的话，<BR>
只是在房间里踱来踱去，煞费苦心地在深思默<BR>

到了他这副面容，而且随即明白了他的心思。<BR>
她对他的魔力一步步在消退了；家庭这样不争<BR>
气，招来了这样的奇耻大辱，自然处处都会惹<BR>
得人家一天比一天看不起。她丝毫不觉得诧异<BR>
，也不怪别人。她即使姑且认为他愿意委曲求<BR>
全，也未必就会感到安慰，未必就会减轻痛苦<BR>
。这反而足发使她愈加有自知之明。现在千恩<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.
Lydia -- the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them
all -- soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her
face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every
thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only
recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her
companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion,
spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long
desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of
my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.  Would to heaven
that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that
might offer consolation to such distress! -- But I will not
torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask
for your thanks.  This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent

at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,
Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor
faulty.  But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such
sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is
so often described as arising on a first interview with its
object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing
can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat
of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek
the other less interesting mode of attachment.  Be that as it
may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of
what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as
she reflected on that wretched business.  Never, since reading
Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's
meaning to marry her.  No one but Jane, she thought, could
flatter herself with such an expectation.  Surprise was the
least of her feelings on this developement.  While the contents
of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise
-- all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it
was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could
ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible.  But now
it was all too natural.  For such an attachment as this, she
might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose
Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that
neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her
from falling an easy prey.

incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance; and
though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia,
her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and
till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was
severe.  Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm,
supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken
suddenly ill; -- but satisfying them instantly on that head,
she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading
the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the
last with trembling energy. -- Though Lydia had never been a
favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be
deeply affected.  Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it;
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror,
Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.
-- Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears
of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every
thing relating to their journey was speedily settled.  They
