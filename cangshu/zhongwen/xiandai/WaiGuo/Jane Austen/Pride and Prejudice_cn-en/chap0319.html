<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which
Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley,
and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.  I wish I could say,
for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her
earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic
felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally
nervous and invariably silly.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太两个最值得疼爱的女儿出嫁的那一<BR>
天，正是她做母亲的生平最高兴的一天。她以<BR>
后去拜访彬格莱太太，在人家面前谈起达西太<BR>
太，是多么得意，多么骄傲，这是可想而知的<BR>
。看她家庭面上，我想在这里作一个说明，她<BR>
所有的女儿后来都得到了归宿，她生平最殷切<BR>
的愿望终于如愿以偿；说来可喜，她后半辈子<BR>
竟因此变成了一个头脑清楚、和蔼可亲、颇有<BR>
见识的女人；不过她有时候还是神经衰弱，经<BR>
常都是痴头怪脑，这也许倒是她丈夫的幸运，<BR>
否则他就无从享受这种稀奇古怪的家庭幸福了<BR>
。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his
affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing
else could do.  He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially
when he was least expected.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特先生非常舍不得第二个女儿；他因为疼<BR>
爱她，便常常去看她，他生平从来不肯这样经<BR>
常出外作客。他喜欢到彭伯里去，而且去起来<BR>
大都是别人完全意料不到的时候。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a
twelvemonth.  So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton
relations was not desirable even to <I>his</I> easy temper, or <I>her</I>
affectionate heart.  The darling wish of his sisters was then
gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to
Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other
source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱先生和吉英在尼日斐花园只住了一年。<BR>
虽说他的脾气非常随和，她的性情亦极其温柔<BR>
，可是夫妇俩都不大愿意和她母亲以及麦里屯<BR>
的亲友们住得太近。后来他在德比郡邻近的一<BR>
个郡里买了一幢房子，于是他姐妹们的衷心愿<BR>
望总算如愿以偿；而吉英和伊丽莎白俩在万重<BR>
幸福上又添了一重幸福，那就是说，姐妹俩从<BR>
此不过相隔三十英里了。<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her
time with her two elder sisters.  In society so superior to
what she had generally known, her improvement was great.  She
was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from
the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper
attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and
less insipid.  From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society
she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the
promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent
to her going.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉蒂最受实惠，大部分时间都消磨在两位姐姐<BR>
那儿。从此她所效的人物都比往常高尚，她本<BR>
身当然也就大有长进。她本来不象丽迪雅那样<BR>
放纵，现在既没有丽迪雅来影响她，又有人对<BR>
她加以妥善的注意和照管，她便不象以前那样<BR>
轻狂无知和麻木不仁了。当然家里少不了要小<BR>
心地管教她，不让她和丽迪雅来往，免得再受<BR>
到她的坏影响；韦蚨太太常常要接她去住，说<BR>
是有多少跳舞会，不多少美少年，她父亲总是<BR>
不让她去。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was
necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by
Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.  Mary was
obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still
moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer
mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her
own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to
the change without much reluctance.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">后来只剩下曼丽还没有出嫁；班纳特太太因为<BR>
不甘寂寞，自然弄得她这个女儿无从探求学问<BR>
。曼丽不得不多多和外界应酬，可是她仍然能<BR>
够用道德的眼光去看待每一次的出外作客。她<BR>
现在再也不用为了和姐妹们争妍比美而操心了<BR>
，因此她父亲不禁怀疑到，她这种改变是否出<BR>
于心甘情愿。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no
revolution from the marriage of her sisters.  He bore with
philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become
acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood
had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing,
was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed
on to make his fortune.  The congratulatory letter which
Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to
her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a
hope was cherished.  The letter was to this effect:
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">说到韦翰和丽迪雅，他们俩的性格并没有因为<BR>
她两位姐姐结婚而有所变化。韦翰想起自己对<BR>
达西种种忘恩负义、虚伪欺诈的事情，伊丽莎<BR>
白虽然从前不知道，现在可完全明白了，不过<BR>
他依旧处之泰然，他多少还指望达西给他一些<BR>
钱。伊丽莎白结婚的时候，接到丽迪雅的一封<BR>
祝贺信。她看得很明白，即使韦翰本人没有存<BR>
那种指望，至少他太太也有那种意思。那封信<BR>
是这样写的：<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">I wish you joy.  If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my
dear Wickham, you must be very happy.  It is a great comfort to
have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope
you will think of us.  I am sure Wickham would like a place at
court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money
enough to live upon without some help.  Any place would do, of
about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak
to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">祝你愉快。要是你爱达西先生抵得上我爱韦翰<BR>
的一半，那你一定会非常幸福了。你能这样富<BR>
有，真叫人十分快慰；当你闲来无事的时候，<BR>
希望你会想到我们。我相信韦翰极其希望在宫<BR>
廷里找份差事做做。要是再没有别人帮帮忙，<BR>
我们便很难维持生计了。随便什么差使都行，<BR>
只要每年有三四百镑的收入。不过，要是你不<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">（下略）<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As it happened that Elizabeth had <I>much</I> rather not, she
endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty
and expectation of the kind.  Such relief, however, as it
was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be
called economy in her own private expences, she frequently
sent them.  It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so
extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must
be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they
changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of
being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging
their bills.  Their manner of living, even when the restoration
of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme.  They were always moving from place to place in quest
of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted
a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she
retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had
given her.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白果然不愿意讲，因此在回信中尽力打<BR>
消她这种希望，断了她这一类的念头。－不过<BR>
伊丽莎白还是尽量把自己平日的用途甘肃省一<BR>
些，积下钱来去接济妹妹。她一向看得很明白<BR>
，他们的收入那么少，两口子又挥霍无度，只<BR>
顾眼前，不顾今后，这当然不够维持生活；每<BR>
逢他们搬家，伊丽莎白或是吉英总是接到他们<BR>
的信，要求接济他们一些钱去偿付账款。即使<BR>
天下太平了，他们退伍回家，他们的生活终究<BR>
难望安定。他们老是东迁西涉，寻找便宜房子<BR>
住，结果总是多花了不少钱。韦翰对丽迪雅不<BR>
久便情淡爱弛，丽迪雅对他比较持久一些，尽<BR>
管她年轻荒唐，还是顾全了婚后应有的名誉。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Though Darcy could never receive <I>him</I> at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was
gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys
they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even Bingley's
good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to <I>talk</I>
of giving them a hint to be gone.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">虽然达西再三不肯让韦翰到彭伯里来，但是看<BR>
在伊丽莎白面上，他依旧帮助他找职业。丽迪<BR>
雅每当丈夫到伦敦去或是到巴思去寻欢作乐的<BR>
时候，也不时到他们那儿去作客；到于彬格莱<BR>
家里，他们夫妇老是一住下来就不想走，弄得<BR>
连彬格莱那样性格温和的人，也觉得不高兴，<BR>
甚至说，要暗示他们走。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but
as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at
Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever
of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and
paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西结婚的时候，彬格莱小姐万分伤心，可是<BR>
她又要在彭伯里保持作客的权利，因此便把多<BR>
少怨气都打消了；她比从前更喜爱乔治安娜，<BR>

白失礼的地方加以弥补。<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the
sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.  They were
able to love each other even as well as they intended.
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;
though at first she often listened with an astonishment
bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking
to her brother.  He, who had always inspired in herself a
respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the
object of open pleasantry.  Her mind received knowledge which
had never before fallen in her way.  By Elizabeth's
instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take
liberties with her husband which a brother will not always
allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">乔治安娜现在长住在彭伯里了；姑嫂之间正如<BR>
达西先生所料到的那么情投意合，互尊互爱，<BR>

哥哥谈起话来，那么活泼调皮，她不禁不为惊<BR>
民，几乎有些担心，因为她一向尊敬哥哥，几<BR>
乎尊敬得超过了手足的情份，想不到现在他竟<BR>
成为公开打趣的对象。她以前无论如何也弄不<BR>
懂的事，现在才恍然大悟了。经过伊丽莎白的<BR>
陶治，她开始懂得，妻子可以对丈夫放纵，做<BR>
哥哥的却不能允许一个比自己小十岁的妹妹调<BR>
皮。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her
nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her
character in her reply to the letter which announced its
arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially
of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on
to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after
a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her
curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she
condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that
pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the
presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and
aunt from the city.

厉害，于是双方有一个短时期断绝过往来后来<BR>
伊丽莎白说服了达西，达西才不再计较这次无<BR>
礼的事，上门去求和；姨母稍许拒绝了一下便<BR>
