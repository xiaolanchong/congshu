The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit
threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor
could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than
incessantly.  Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken
the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose
of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.  It was
a rational scheme, to be sure!  but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to
imagine; till she recollected that <u>his</u> being the intimate
friend of Bingley, and <u>her</u> being the sister of Jane, was
enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made
everybody eager for another, to supply the idea.  She had not
herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must
bring them more frequently together.  And her neighbours at
Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with
the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady
Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and
immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at
some future time.
<BR></TD>

这不速之客去了以后，伊丽莎白很是心神不安<br>
，而且很不容易恢复宁静。她接连好几个钟头<br>
不断地思索着这件事。咖苔琳夫人这次居然不<br>
怕麻烦，远从罗新斯赶来，原来是她自己异想<br>
天开，认为伊丽莎白和达西先生已经订了婚，<br>
所以特地赶来要把他们拆散。这个办法倒的确<br>
很好；可是，关于他们订婚的谣传，究竟有什<br>
么根据呢？这真叫伊丽莎白无从想象，后来她<br>
才想起了达西旧彬格莱的好朋友，她自己是吉<br>
英的妹妹，而目前大家往往会因为一重婚姻而<br>
连带想到再结一重婚姻，那么，人们自然要生<br>
出这种念头来了。她自己也早就想到，姐姐结<br>
婚以后，她和达西先生见面的机会也就更多了<br>
。因此卢家庄的邻居们（她认为只有他们和柯<br>
林斯夫妇通信的时候会说起这件事，因此才会<br>
传到咖苔琳夫人那里去）竟把这件事看成十拿<br>
九稳，而且好事就在眼前，可是她自己只不过<br>
觉得这件事将来有点希望而已。

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">
In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could
not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence
of her persisting in this interference.  From what she had said
of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to
Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;
and how <u>he</u> might take a similar representation of the evils
attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or
his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than <u>she</u> could
do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a
marriage with <u>one</u>, whose immediate connections were so unequal
to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.
With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the
arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous,
contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
不过，一想起咖苔琳夫人那番话，她就禁不住<br>
有些感到不安；如果她硬要干涉，谁也说不出<br>
会造成怎样的后果。她说她坚决要阻档这一门<br>
亲事，从这些话看来，伊丽莎白想到夫人准会<br>
去找她的姨侄；至于达西是不是也同样认为跟<br>
她结婚有那么多害处，那她就不敢说了。她不<br>
知道他跟他姨母之间感情如何，也不知道他是<br>
否完全听他姨母的主张，可是按情理来说，他<br>
一定会比伊丽莎白看得起那位老夫人。只要他<br>
姨妈在他面前说明他们两家门第不相当，跟这<br>
样出身的女人结婚有多少害处，那就会击中他<br>
的弱点。咖苔琳夫人说了那么一大堆理由，伊<br>
丽莎白当然觉得荒唐可笑，不值一驳，可是有<br>
他那样一个死要面子的人看来，也许会觉得见<br>
解高明，理由充足。

If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which
had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a
relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to
be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.  In that
case he would return no more.  Lady Catherine might see him in
her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming
again to Netherfield must give way.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
如果他本来就心里动摇不定（他好象时常如此<br>
），那么，只要这位至亲去规劝他一下，央求<br>
他一下，他自会立刻打消犹豫，下定决心，再<br>
不要为了追求幸福而眨低自己的身份。如果真<br>
是这样，那他一定再也不会回来。咖苔琳夫人<br>
路过城里，也许会去找他，他虽然和彬格莱先<br>
生有约在先，答应立即回到尼日斐花园来，这<br>
一下恐怕只能作罢了。

"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should
come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall
know how to understand it.  I shall then give over every
expectation, every wish of his constancy.  If he is satisfied
with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my
affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">
她心里又想：“要是彬格莱先生这几天里就接<br>
到他的信，托辞不能践约，我便一切都明白了<br>
，不必再去对他存什么指望，不必去希求他始<br>
终如一。当我现在快要爱上他、答应他求婚的<br>
时候，如果他并不真心爱我，而只是惋惜我一<br>
下，那么，我便马上连惋惜他的心肠也不会有<br>
。”

The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their
visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied
it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased
Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much

She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he

anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.

The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the

"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship
last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension,
expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it become apparent,
that on the score of some family objections on the part of my
cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so
disgraceful a match.  I thought it my duty to give the speediest
intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble
admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.'
Mr. Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin
Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only
concerned that their living together before the marriage took
place should be so generally known.  I must not, however,
neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my
amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into
your house as soon as they were married.  It was an encouragement
of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very
strenuously have opposed it.  You ought certainly to forgive them,
as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow
their names to be mentioned in your hearing.'  That is his notion
of Christian forgiveness!  The rest of his letter is only about
his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young
olive-branch.  But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.

It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of
Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder
at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead
of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.
