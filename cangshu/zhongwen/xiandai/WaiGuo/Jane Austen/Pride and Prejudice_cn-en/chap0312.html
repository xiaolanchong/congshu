<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover
her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption
on those subjects that must deaden them more.  Mr. Darcy's
behaviour astonished and vexed her.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他们一走，伊丽莎白便到屋外去留达，好让自<BR>
己精神舒畅一下，换句话说，也就是不停去想<BR>
那些足以使她精神更加沉闷的念头。达西先生<BR>
的行为叫她惊奇，也叫她烦恼。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,"
said she, "did he come at all?"
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她想：“要是他这次来是为了要沉默寡言，庄<BR>
严冷淡，那他又何必来？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and
aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?  If he fears me,
why come hither?  If he no longer cares for me, why silent?
Teasing, teasing, man!  I will think no more about him."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他在城里的时候，对我的舅父母依旧很和气<BR>

弄人的男子！今后我再也不去想念他了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by
the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful
look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors,
than Elizabeth.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">姐姐走近前来，使她不得不把这个念头暂时搁<BR>
在一旁。她一见姐姐神色欣然，便知道这两位<BR>
贵客虽使她自己失意，却使她姐姐较为得意。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel
perfectly easy.  I know my own strength, and I shall never be
embarrassed again by his coming.  I am glad he dines here on
Tuesday.  It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides,
we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">姐姐说：“第一次见面总算过去了，我倒觉得<BR>
非常自在。这次我既然能够应付，等他下次再<BR>
来，我便不会发窘。他星期二能到这儿来吃饭<BR>
，我倒很高兴，因为到那时候，大家都会看出<BR>
，我和他不过是无所谓的普通朋友。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly.
"Oh, Jane, take care."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白笑着说：“好一个无所谓的朋友！吉<BR>
英，还是当心点儿好！”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger
now?"

<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我看你有极大的危险，会叫他如醉如痴地爱<BR>
你。”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and
Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the
happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness
of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">直到星期二，她们方才又见到那两位贵客。班<BR>
纳特太太因为上次看到彬格莱先生在那短短的<BR>
半小时访问过程中，竟然兴致极高，礼貌又好<BR>
，因此这几天来便一直在打着如意算盘。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn;
and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of
their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.  When
they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to
see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their
former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.  Her
prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite
him to sit by herself.  On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to
smile: it was decided.  He placed himself by her.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">且说那天浪搏恩来了许多客人；主人家最渴盼<BR>
的两位嘉宾都准时而到，游猎家果然是严守时<BR>
刻，名不虚传。两人一走进饭厅，伊丽莎白连<BR>
忙注意彬格莱先生，看他是不是在吉英身旁坐<BR>
下，因为从前每逢有宴会，他都是坐在那个位<BR>
子上。她那精明的母亲也有同感，因此并没有<BR>
请他坐到她自己身边去。他刚走进饭厅的时候<BR>
，好象颇有些犹豫，增亏吉英凑巧回过头来，<BR>
凑巧在微笑，他这才拿定主意，在她身边坐下<BR>
。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his
friend.  He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have
imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy,
had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy,
with an expression of half-laughing alarm.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白看得很是得意，不由得朝他那位朋友<BR>
望了一眼，只见达西落落大方，若无其事。她<BR>
要不是恰巧看见彬格莱先生又惊又喜地也对达<BR>
西先生望了一眼，她还以为他这次之所以能够<BR>
称心如意，是事先蒙到达西先生恩准的呢。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as
showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than
formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,
Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet
received pleasure from observing his behaviour.  It gave her
all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour.  Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as
the table could divide them.  He was on one side of her mother.
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to
either, or make either appear to advantage.  She was not near
enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how
seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was
their manner whenever they did.  Her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to
Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any
thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was
neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吃饭的时候，彬格莱先生果然对她姐姐露出了<BR>
爱慕之意。虽然这种爱慕表现得没有从前那样<BR>
露骨，可是伊丽莎白却觉得，只要能够完全让<BR>
他自己作主，吉英的幸福和他自己的幸福一定<BR>
马上就可以十拿九稳。虽然她不敢过存奢望，<BR>
可是看到他那样的态度，实在叫她高兴。她当<BR>
时心情虽然并不十分愉快，这来却使她精神上<BR>
得到了极大的鼓舞。达西先生的座位和她隔得<BR>
那么远，他和她母亲坐在一起。她觉得这无论<BR>
是对于达西，对于她母亲，都是兴味索然，两<BR>
不方便。座位隔得远了，她自然听不清达西跟<BR>
她母亲讲些什么，可是她看得出他们俩很少谈<BR>
话，谈起来又非常拘泥，非常冷淡。看看母亲<BR>
对他那样敷衍应酬，再想想他对她们家里情深<BR>
谊重，她当做分外难受。有几次她真恨不得能<BR>
够告诉他说，她家里并不是没有人知道他的好<BR>
处，并不是全家都对他忘恩负义。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity
of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would
not pass away without enabling them to enter into something
more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation
attending his entrance.  Anxious and uneasy, the period which
passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was
wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.
She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她但愿这个下午彼此能够亲近一些，多谈些话<BR>
，不要辜负了他这一场拜访，不要让他只是在<BR>
进门时听到她照例地招呼一声，便一无所获。<BR>
她感到万分焦急不安，因此在两位贵客没有走<BR>
进会客室以前，她几乎厌倦沉闷得快要发脾气<BR>
了。她一心盼望他们进来，因为整个下午的兴<BR>
致完全在此一着。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"If he does not come to me, <I>then</I>," said she, "I shall give
him up for ever."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她想：“假如那时候他依旧不到我跟前来，我<BR>
只好永远把他放弃。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would
have answered her hopes; but, alas!  the ladies had crowded
round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and
Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy
that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit
of a chair.  And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the
girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">两位贵客进来了；看他那副神情，她倒觉得他<BR>
不会辜负她一片心意。可是天哪！班纳特小姐<BR>
在桌子上斟茶，伊丽莎白在洒咖啡，女客们却<BR>
把这张桌子团团围住，大家挤在一起，摆一张<BR>
椅子的空地方也没有。他们进来以后，有一个<BR>
姑娘又向伊丽莎白身边更挨近一些，跟她低声<BR>
说道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.  We want
none of them; do we?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我决计不让这般男人来把我们分开。不管哪<BR>
个男人，我们都不让他来，好不好？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.  She
followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke,
had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and
then was enraged against herself for being so silly!
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西只得走开。伊丽莎白眼睛盯牢着他看随便<BR>
看到什么人跟他说话，她都觉得嫉妒。她几乎<BR>
没有心思给客人们洒咖啡了。过了一会儿，她<BR>
又埋怨自己不该这样痴心。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"A man who has once been refused!  How could I ever be foolish
enough to expect a renewal of his love?  Is there one among the
sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second
proposal to the same woman?  There is no indignity so abhorrent
to their feelings!"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他是一个被我拒绝过的男人！我怎么蠢到这<BR>
般地步，竟会指望他重新爱上我？哪一个男人<BR>
会这样没有骨气，，向一个女人求第二次婚？<BR>
他们决不屑做这种丢面子的事！”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his
coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这时只见他亲自把咖啡杯送回来，因此她总算<BR>
稍微高兴了一些，立即抓住这个机会跟他说话<BR>
：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你妹妹还在彭伯里吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“还在，她一直要在那儿待到圣诞节。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And quite alone?  Have all her friends left her?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“只有她一个人吗？她的朋友都走了没有？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Mrs. Annesley is with her.  The others have been gone on to
Scarborough, these three weeks."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“安涅斯雷太太跟她在一起。别的人都在三个<BR>
星期以前上斯卡巴勒去了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to
converse with her, he might have better success.  He stood by
her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on
the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她想不出别的话可说了；不过，只要他愿意跟<BR>
她谈话，他自有办法。他默默无言地在她身旁<BR>
站了几分钟，后来那位年轻的小姐又眼伊丽莎<BR>
白咬起耳朵来，他又只得走开。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed,
the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon
joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him
fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and
in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.  She
now lost every expectation of pleasure.  They were confined for
the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope,
but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the
room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">等到茶具撤走、牌桌全摆好以后，女客们都站<BR>
起身来，这时伊丽莎白更希望他立刻就到自己<BR>
身边来，但见她母亲在四处硬拉人打“惠斯脱<BR>
”，他也情面难却，顷刻之间就和从宾客一，<BR>
坐上牌桌，于是她一切的希望都落了空。她满<BR>
怀的兴致都变成泡影。今晚她已毫无指望。两<BR>
个人只得各坐牌桌一张，达西的眼睛频频向她<BR>
这边看，结果两个人都打输了牌。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen
to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any
of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太本来打算留尼日斐花园的这两位贵<BR>
客吃晚饭，不幸的是，他们吩咐佣人套车比谁<BR>
都先，因此她没有机会留他们。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to
themselves, "What say you to the day?  I think every thing has
passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.  The dinner was as
well dressed as any I ever saw.  The venison was roasted to a
turn -- and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch.  The
soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases'
last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three
French cooks at least.  And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look
in greater beauty.  Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her
whether you did not.  And what do you think she said besides?
``Ah!  Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.''
She did indeed.  I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as
ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and
not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">客人们一走，班纳特太太便说：“孩子们，今<BR>
天过得快活吗？告诉你们，我觉得一切都非常<BR>
顺利。饭菜烹调得从来没有过的那么好。鹿肉<BR>
烧得恰到好处，大家都说，从来没有见过这么<BR>
肥的腰肉。说到汤，比起我们上星期在卢卡斯<BR>
家里吃的，那可不知要好多少。连达西先生也<BR>
承认鹧鸪烧得美极了，我看他自己至少用了三<BR>
个法国厨子呢。再说，亲爱的吉英，我从来没<BR>
有看见你比今天更美。郎格太太也这么说，因<BR>
为我在她面前问过你美不美。你猜她还说了些<BR>
什么？她说：‘呃！班纳特太太，她少不了要<BR>
嫁到尼日斐花园去的。她真是这么说来着。我<BR>
觉得郎格太太这个人真是太好了；她的侄女们<BR>
都是些规规矩矩的好姑娘，只可惜长得一点也<BR>
不好看。我真喜欢她们。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen
enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she
would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her
family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that
she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the
next day, to make his proposals.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">总而言之，班纳特太太今天的确高兴极了。她<BR>
把彬格莱对吉英的一举一动全看在眼里，因此<BR>
相信吉英一定会把他弄到手。她一时高兴，便<BR>
不禁想入非非，一心只指望这门亲事会给她家<BR>
里带来多少多少好处，等到第二天不见他来求<BR>
婚，她又大失所望。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to
Elizabeth.  "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable
one with the other.  I hope we may often meet again."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特小姐对伊丽莎白说：“今天一天过得真<BR>
有意思，来吃饭的客人都挑选得那么好，大家<BR>
都很投机。我希望今后我们能够常常聚会。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth smiled.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白笑了笑。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Lizzy, you must not do so.  You must not suspect me.  It
mortifies me.  I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy
his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man,
without having a wish beyond it.  I am perfectly satisfied,
from what his manners now are, that he never had any design
of engaging my affection.  It is only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of
generally pleasing, than any other man."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“丽萃，请你千万不要笑，千万不要疑心我。<BR>
这会使我难受。告诉你吧，我只不过很欣赏这<BR>
样一位聪明和蔼的年轻人的谈吐，并没有存别<BR>
的非份之想。他的整个举止作风中间，有一点<BR>
我完全感到满意，那就是他绝对没有想要博得<BR>
我的欢心。只不过他的谈吐实在比别人美妙，<BR>
而且他也比别人随和。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me
smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">只听得妹妹说：“你真狠心，你不让我笑，又<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.  We all
love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth

not make me your confidante."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这话可收我无从回答了。我们都喜欢替人家<BR>
