## 莫 not, negative

艹 grass, plants + 日 sun + 大 big

In the ancient past, this character actually meant when the sun goes down underneath the plants or grass. 
As you can see, the da character here is attached to the sun and the two lines at the bottom kind of resemble a shadow. 
The sunset is kind of a negation of the day. 
In the same way, this character now means basically to make something negative.

## 模 imitate, model, pattern, or norm

莫 not + 木 tree, wood

sun that was setting and its shadow was being cast across the land. 
A tree which can make wood can then be used to construct things which are also imitations of the real world just like a shadow is practically an imitation of a real thing. 
This reminds me of Plato's allegory of the cave where he also used shadows. 
Plato said that humans all have ideas in their heads of perfect things, but we can never be able to actually create real things. 
We can never be able to take those perfect things and create them in the real world. 
They will always just be imitations. 
In turn, when we make imitations of ideas, they can then be used to set a pattern as people imitate them and it becomes a norm. 
Take mannequins in the fashion industry. 
People make them and although they are not real humans, they are used to set a standard for what a basic human is like. 
And then people can use that to create clothes and all those clothes are imitations of one another. 
And therefore there is a pattern of what those clothes all look like. They look the same. 

## 摸 feel about with the hand

莫 not + 扌 hand

莫 resembles a sun setting and the shadow is being cast across the land. 
This is signifying that we are going from the daytime till the nighttime. 
People are most likely to search about in the darkness when it is dark. 

## 漠 desert

莫 not + 氵 water

A *desert* is a place that does *not* have *water*.

## 墓 grave, tomb, mausoleum

莫 not + 土 dirtu, ground

death is basically the *negative* of life. 
And in a lot of countries, people are buried in the *ground* after they die. 
So moo means *grave, mausoleum or tomb*.

## 寞 lonesome, deserted

莫 not + 宀 roof

if you are a person living underneath a *ROOF* and there is *NO ONE* else, it can be kind of *lonesome*. 
If there is a building and there is no one or nothing underneath it, people think that it is *deserted*.

## 募 raise, recruite

莫 not + 力 power, force

Originally with farmers.
If you one person and need to complete a hard task but you have *NO ONE*,
You need to find a *human force, human power, manforce*. You will go out and *recruite* them.
