Upper-Intermediate - Buying a House

(D1171)

A

小江，你看，首付二十万，轻松入住地铁房！

Xiǎo Jiāng, nǐ kàn, shǒufù èrshí wàn, qīngsōng rùzhù dìtiěfáng!

Look, Xiao Jiang, you pay two hundred thousand yuan as a down payment, and you can start living in your house near the subway!

B

广告都是骗人的。这个地铁不知道什么时候才能造好呢！而且我光棍儿一条，不用考虑这个事情。

guǎnggào dōu shì piànrén de. zhè ge  dìtiě bù zhīdào shénme shíhou cáinéng zàohǎo ne! érqiě wǒ guānggùnr yī tiáo, bùyòng kǎolǜ zhè ge shìqing.

Ads are just lies. Who knows when this metro line will be finished?! Anyway, I'm single. I don't need to think about this stuff.

A

你到时候再考虑就来不及了。没房子，谁肯嫁给你啊？

nǐ dào shíhou zài kǎolǜ jiù láibují le. méi fángzi, shéi kěn jiàgěi nǐ a?

It'll be too late if you don't think about it now. Who'll want to marry you if you don't have a house?

B

那正好，反正我也不急着结婚。再说，为了一套房子嫁给我的女孩儿，我才不要呢！

nà zhènghǎo, fǎnzhèng wǒ yě bù jí zhe jiéhūn. zàishuō, wèile yī tào fángzi jiàgěi wǒ de nǚháir, wǒ cái bù yào ne!

That works perfectly. I'm not in a hurry to get married, anyway. Plus, I don't want a girl who'd marry me just for my house.

A

不是说她贪你的房子，而是有了房子啊，心里才踏实。这是结婚的先决条件。

bù shì shuō tā tān nǐ de fángzi, érshì yǒu le fángzi a, xīnli cái tāshi. zhè shì jiéhūn de xiānjué tiáojiàn.

It's not that she's after your house, it's that she'll only feel safe and secure if you have your own house. This is a prerequisite for marriage.

B

我看都是为了面子，没房子结婚总觉得不体面。总之，我们辛苦赚的钱都送到房地产商口袋里了。

wǒ kàn dōu shì wèile miànzi, méi fángzi jiéhūn zǒng juéde bù tǐmiàn. zǒngzhī, wǒmen xīnkǔ zhuàn de qián dōu sòngdào fángdìchǎnshāng kǒudài lǐ le.

I think it's all about face. It doesn't seem proper to get married without your own house. Basically, this puts our hard-earned money into the pockets of real estate companies.

A

哎，小江，我是过来人。不管是什么理由，房子是结婚的门票，一定要买的。而且趁年轻，没孩子，咬咬牙买一套。以后你就知道好处了。

āi, Xiǎo Jiāng, wǒ shì guòláirén. bùguǎn shì shénme lǐyóu, fángzi shì jiéhūn de ménpiào, yīdìng yào mǎi de. érqiě chèn niánqīng, méi háizi, yǎoyao yá mǎi yī tào. yǐhòu nǐ jiù zhīdào hǎochu le.

Agh, Xiao Jiang, I have some experience with this. Regardless of the reason, a house is your ticket to marriage. You have to buy one. And you should take advantage of the fact that you're young and don't have any kids. Grit your teeth and buy a house! Later on, you'll understand why it's a good idea.

B

可是我一个月的工资还不够买一个平方呢！

kěshì wǒ yī ge yuè de gōngzī hái bù gòu mǎi yī ge píngfāng ne!

But I don't even make enough per month to buy a single square meter!

A

现在的年轻人买房有几个是靠自己的？首付先让你爸妈垫上，以后你慢慢还。而且房子总会升值的，也算投资。

xiànzài de niánqīngrén mǎifáng yǒu jǐ ge shì kào zìjǐ de? shǒufù xiān ràng nǐ bàmā diànshàng, yǐhòu nǐ mànmàn huán. érqiě fángzi zǒng huì shēngzhí de, yě suàn tóuzī.

How many young people these days rely on themselves when they buy a house? Have your mom and dad cover the down payment. You can pay them back gradually later on. A house will increase in value, anyway. Think of it as an investment.

B

我可不想靠家里买房。我是男人，要靠自己。

wǒ kě bù xiǎng kào jiālǐ mǎifáng. wǒ shì nánrén, yào kào zìjǐ.

I don't want to rely on my family to buy a house. I'm a man. I should get by on my own.

A

靠自己，那你五十岁都讨不到老婆。

kào zìjǐ, nà nǐ wǔshí suì dōu tǎobudào  lǎopó.

On your own? Then you won't be able to find a wife even when you're fifty!
