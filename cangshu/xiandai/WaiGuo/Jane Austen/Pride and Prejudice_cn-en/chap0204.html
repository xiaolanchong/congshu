<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and
otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,
sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February
pass away.  March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.  She had
not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but
Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she
gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty.  Absence had increased her desire
of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr.
Collins.  There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a
mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be
faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in
short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry
for any delay.  Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was
finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.  She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.  The
improvement of spending a night in London was added in time,
and the plan became perfect as plan could be.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">浪搏恩这家人家除了这些事以外，再没有别的<BR>
大事；除了到麦里屯去散散步以外，再没有别<BR>
的消遣。时而雨水泞途、时而风寒刺骨的正月<BR>
和二月，就这样过去了。三月里伊丽莎白要上<BR>
汉斯福去。开头她并不是真想去；可是她立刻<BR>
想到夏绿蒂对于原来的约定寄予了很大的期望<BR>
，于是她也就带着比较乐意和比较肯定的心情<BR>
来考虑这个问题了。离别促进了她想夏绿蒂重<BR>
逢的愿望，也消除了她对柯林斯先生的厌恶。<BR>
这个计划多少总有它新奇的地方；再说，家里<BR>
有了这样的母亲和这样几位不能融洽的妹妹，<BR>
自难完美无缺，换换环境也好。趁着旅行的机<BR>
会也可去看看吉英；总之，时日迫近了，她反<BR>
而有些等不及了。她在一切都进行得很顺利，<BR>
最后依旧照了夏绿蒂原先的意思，跟威廉爵士<BR>
和他的第二个女儿一块儿去作一次客。以后这<BR>
计划又补充了一下，决定在伦敦住一夜，这一<BR>
来可真是个十全十美的计划了。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly
miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked
her going that he told her to write to him, and almost promised
to answer her letter.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">只有和父亲离别使她感到痛苦，父亲一定会记<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly
friendly; on his side even more.  His present pursuit could not
make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and
to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the
first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu,
wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to
expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion
of her -- their opinion of every body -- would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever
attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted
from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must
always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她跟韦翰先生告别时，双方都十分客气，韦翰<BR>
比她还要客气。他目前虽然在追求别人，却并<BR>
没有因此就忘了伊丽莎白是第一个引起他注目<BR>
的人，第一个值得他注目的人，第一个听他倾<BR>
诉衷情，第一个可怜他，第一个搏得了他爱慕<BR>
的人；他向她告别，祝她万事如意，又对她说<BR>
了一遍德・包尔夫人是臬的一个人，他相信他<BR>
们俩对那位老夫人的评价，对每一个人的评价<BR>
，一定完全吻合。他说这话的时候，显得很是<BR>
热诚，很是关切，这种盛情一定会使她对他永<BR>
远怀着极其深挚的好感。他们分手以后，她更<BR>
相信不管他结婚也罢，单身也罢，他在她的心<BR>
目中将会始终是一个极其和蔼可亲而又讨人喜<BR>
欢的人。<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make
her think him less agreeable.  Sir William Lucas and his
daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as
himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and
were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of
the chaise.  Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir
William's too long.  He could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities
were worn out like his information.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">第二天和她同路的那些人，也并没有使韦翰在<BR>
她心目中相形见绌。威廉爵士简直说不出一句<BR>
中听的话，他那位女儿玛丽亚虽然脾气很好，<BR>
脑子却象她父亲一样空洞，也说不出一句中听<BR>
的话。听他们父女俩说话，就好象听到车辆的<BR>
辘辘声一样无聊。伊丽莎白本来爱听无稽之谈<BR>
，不过威廉爵士那一套她实在听得腻了。他谈<BR>
来谈去总不外乎觐见皇上以及荣膺爵士头衔之<BR>
类的奇闻，翻不出什么新花样来；他那一套礼<BR>
貌举止，也象他的出言吐语一样，已经陈腐不<BR>
堪。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it
so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.  As they drove
to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window
watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was
there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her
face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.  On
the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose
eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not
seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.  All
was joy and kindness.  The day passed most pleasantly away; the
morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the
theatres.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这段旅程不过二十四英里路，他们启程很早，<BR>
为的是要在正午赶到天恩寺街。他们走近嘉丁<BR>
纳先生的大门时，吉英正在会客室的窗口望着<BR>
他们。他们走近过道时，吉英正等在那儿接他<BR>
们，伊丽莎白真挚地仔细望了望吉英的脸，只<BR>
见那张脸蛋儿还是象往常一样地健康美丽，她<BR>
觉得很高兴。男男女女的孩子们为了急于要见<BR>
到表奶，在客厅里等不及，又因为一年没见面<BR>
，不好意思下楼去，便都待在楼梯口。到处是<BR>
一片欢乐与和善的气氛。这一天真过得极其愉<BR>
快；上午乱哄哄地忙做一团，又要出去买东西<BR>
；晚上上戏院去看戏。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.  Their first
subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than
astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that
though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were
periods of dejection.  It was reasonable, however, to hope,
that they would not continue long.  Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street,
and repeated conversations occurring at different times between
Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her
heart, given up the acquaintance.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白在舅母身旁坐下来。她们俩首先就谈<BR>
到她姐姐。她仔仔细细问了许多话，舅母回答<BR>
她说，吉英虽然竭力提着精神，还免不了有交<BR>
易所意气消沉的时候，她听了并不十分诧异，<BR>
却很忧郁。她在这种意气消沉的现象还会继续<BR>
多久。嘉丁纳太太也跟伊丽莎白谈起彬格莱小<BR>
姐过访天恩寺街的一切情形，又把吉英跟她好<BR>
几次的谈话重述了一遍给她听，这些话足以说<BR>
明吉英的确打算再不和彬格莱小姐来往了。<BR></TD>

when we <I>do</I> return, it shall not be like other travellers,
without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.  We
<I>will</I> know where we have gone -- we <I>will</I> recollect what we
have seen.  Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled
together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe
any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its
