<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. -- She felt all the perverseness
of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was
brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to
inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. --
How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! --
Yet it did, and even a third.  It seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it
was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and
then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back
and walk with her.  He never said a great deal, nor did she
give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but
it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he
was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure
in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in
speaking of Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the
house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent
again she would be staying <I>there</I> too.  His words seemed to
imply it.  Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion
to what might arise in that quarter.  It distressed her a
little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in
the pales opposite the Parsonage.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白在花园里散步的时候，曾经好多次出<BR>
乎意料地碰见达西先生。别人不来的地方他偏<BR>
偏会来，这真是不幸，她觉得好象是命运在故<BR>
意跟她闹别扭。她第一次就对他说，她喜欢独<BR>
自一人到这地方来溜达，当时的用意就是不让<BR>
以后再有这种事情发生。如果会有第二次，那<BR>
才叫怪呢。然而毕竟有了第二次，甚至还会有<BR>
第三次，看上去他好象是故意跟她过不去，否<BR>
则就是有心要来赔浊；因为这几次他既不是跟<BR>
她敷衍几句就哑口无言，也不是稍隔一会儿就<BR>
走开，而是当真掉过头来跟她一块儿走走。他<BR>
从来不多说话，她也懒得多讲，懒得多听；可<BR>
是第三次见面的时候，他问她住在汉斯福快活<BR>
不快活，问她为什么喜欢孤单单一个人散步，<BR>
又问起她是不是觉得柯林斯夫妇很幸福。谈起<BR>
罗新斯，她说她对于那家人家不大了解，他倒<BR>
好象希望她以后每逢有机会再到肯特来，也会<BR>
去那儿小住一阵，从他的出言吐语里面听得出<BR>
他有这层意思。难道他在替费茨威廉上校转念<BR>
头吗？她想，如果他当真话里不音，那他一定<BR>
暗示那个人对她有些动心。她觉得有些痛苦，<BR>
她在已经走到牧师住宅对过的围墙门口，因此<BR>
又觉得很高兴。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's
last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that
Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again
surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up, that Colonel
Fitzwilliam was meeting her.  Putting away the letter
immediately and forcing a smile, she said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">有一天，她正在一面散步，一面重新读着吉英<BR>
上一次的来信，把吉英心灰意冷时所写的那几<BR>

抬头一看，只见这次并不是达西，而是费茨威<BR>
廉上校正在迎面走来。她立刻收起了那封信，<BR>
勉强做出一副笑脸，说道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“没想到你也会到这儿来。”费茨威廉回答道<BR>
：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I
generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at
the Parsonage.  Are you going much farther?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我每年都是这样，临走以前总得要到花园里<BR>
各处去兜一圈，最后上牧师家来拜望。你还要<BR>
往前走吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"No, I should have turned in a moment."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不，我马上就要回去了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the
Parsonage together.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">于是她果真转过身来，两人一同朝着牧师住宅<BR>
走去。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你真的星期六就要离开肯特吗？”她问。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes -- if Darcy does not put it off again.  But I am at his
disposal.  He arranges the business just as he pleases."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“是的，只要达西不再拖延。不过我得听他调<BR>
遣。他办起事来只是凭他自己高兴。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has
at least great pleasure in the power of choice.  I do not know
any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he
likes than Mr. Darcy."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“即使不能顺着他自己的意思去摆布，至少也<BR>
要顺着他自己意思去选择一下。我从来没有看<BR>

，为所欲为。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel
Fitzwilliam.  "But so we all do.  It is only that he has better
means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and
many others are poor.  I speak feelingly.  A younger son, you
know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他太任性了，”费茨威廉上校回答道。“可<BR>
是我们全都如此。只不过他比一般人有条件，<BR>
可以那么做，因为他有钱，一般人穷。我是说<BR>
的真心话。你知道，一个小儿子可就不得不克<BR>
制自己，仰仗别人。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little
of either.  Now, seriously, what have you ever known of
self-denial and dependence?  When have you been prevented by
want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any
thing you had a fancy for?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“在我看来，一个伯爵的小儿子，对这两件事<BR>
简直就一点儿不懂。再说，史倒要问你一句正<BR>
经话，你又懂得什么叫做克制自己和仰仗别人<BR>
呢？我有没有哪一次因为没有钱，想去什么地<BR>
方去不成，爱买一样东西买不成？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"These are home questions -- and perhaps I cannot say that
I have experienced many hardships of that nature.  But in
matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money.
Younger sons cannot marry where they like."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你问得好，或许我在这方面也是不知艰苦。<BR>
可是遇到重大问题，我可能就会因为没有钱而<BR>
吃苦了。小儿子往往有了意中人而不能结婚。<BR>
”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they
very often do."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“除非是爱上了有钱的女人，我认为这种情形<BR>
他们倒往往会碰到。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not
many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some
attention to money."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我们花钱花惯了，因此不得不依赖别人，象<BR>
我这样身份的人，结起婚来能够不讲钱，那可<BR>
数不出几个了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured
at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone,
"And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?
Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would
not ask above fifty thousand pounds."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这些话都是对我说的吗？”伊丽莎白想到这<BR>
里，不禁脸红；可是她立刻恢复了常态，用一<BR>
种很活泼的声调说道：“请问一个伯爵的小儿<BR>
子，通常值多少身价？我想，除非哥哥身体太<BR>
坏，你讨起价来总不能超过五万镑。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected
with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他也用同样的口吻回答了她，这事便不再提。<BR>
可是她又怕这样沉默下去，他会以为她是听了<BR>
刚才那番话心里难受，因此隔了一会儿，她便<BR>
说道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for
the sake of having somebody at his disposal.  I wonder he does
not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.  But,
perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is
under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我想，你表兄把你带来待在他身边，主要就<BR>
是为了要有个人听他摆布。我不懂他为什么还<BR>
不结婚，结了婚不就是可以有个人一辈子听他<BR>
摆布了吗？不过，目前他有个妹妹也许就行了<BR>
；既然现在由他一个人照管她，那他就可以爱<BR>
怎么对待她就怎么对待她了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he
must divide with me.  I am joined with him in the guardianship
of Miss Darcy."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不”费茨威廉上校说，“这份好处还得让我<BR>
分享。我也是达西小姐的保护人。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Are you, indeed?  And pray what sort of guardians do you make?
Does your charge give you much trouble?  Young ladies of her
age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has
the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你真的是吗？请问，你这位保护人当得怎么<BR>
样？你们这位小姐相当难待候吧？象她那样年<BR>
纪的小姐，胡时候真不大容易对付；假若她的<BR>
脾气也和达西一模一样，她自然也会样样事都<BR>
凭她自己高兴。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and
the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed
Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her
that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.  She
directly replied,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她说这话的时候，只见他在情恳意切望着她。<BR>
他马上就问她说，为什么她会想到达西小姐可<BR>
能使他们感到棘手。她看他问这句话的神态，<BR>
就愈发断定自己果真猜得很接近事实。她立刻<BR>
回答道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You need not be frightened.  I never heard any harm of her;
and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in
the world.  She is a very great favourite with some ladies of
my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.  I think I have
heard you say that you know them."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你不必慌张。我从来没有听到过她有什么坏<BR>
处；而且我敢说，她是世界上最听话的一位姑<BR>
娘。我的女朋友们中有几个人，譬如赫斯脱太<BR>
太和彬格莱小姐，都喜欢得她了不得。我好象<BR>
听你说过，你也认识她们的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I know them a little.  Their brother is a pleasant
gentleman-like man -- he is a great friend of Darcy's."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我和她们不大熟。她们的兄弟是个富有风趣<BR>
的绅士派人物，是达西的好朋友。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  yes," said Elizabeth drily -- "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly
kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of
him."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢，是呀，”伊丽莎白冷冷地说：“达西先<BR>
生待彬格莱先生特别好，也照顾得他十二万分<BR>
周到。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Care of him! -- Yes, I really believe Darcy <I>does</I> take care
of him in those points where he most wants care.  From
something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason
to think Bingley very much indebted to him.  But I ought to beg
his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the
person meant.  It was all conjecture."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“照顾他！是的，我的确相信，几是他拿不出<BR>
办法的事情，达西先生总会替他想出办法。我<BR>
们到这儿来，路上他告诉了我一些事情，我听<BR>
了以后，便相信彬格莱先生确实多亏他帮了些<BR>
忙。可是我得请他原谅，我没有权利猜想他所<BR>
说的那个人就是彬格莱。那完全是瞎猜罢了。<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"What is it you mean?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你这话是什么意思？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It is a circumstance which Darcy, of course, would not wish to
be generally known, because if it were to get round to the
lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这件事达西先生当然不愿意让大家知道，免<BR>
得传到那位小姐家里去，惹得人家不痛快。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你放心好了，我不会说出去的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to
be Bingley.  What he told me was merely this; that he
congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the
inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without
mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected
it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to
get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have
been together the whole of last summer."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“请你记住，我并没有足够的理由猜想他所说<BR>
的那个人就是彬格莱。他只不过告诉我，他最<BR>
近使一位朋友没有结成一门冒味的婚姻，免却<BR>
了多少麻烦，他觉得这件事值得自慰，可是他<BR>
并没有提到当事人的姓名和其中的细节；我所<BR>
以会疑心到彬格莱身上，一则因为我相信象他<BR>
那样的青年，的确会招来这样的麻烦，二则因<BR>
为我知道，他们在一起度过了整整一个夏天。<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“达西先生有没有说他为了什么理由要管人家<BR>
闲事？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I understood that there were some very strong objections
against the lady."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我听说那位小姐有些条件太不够格。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And what arts did he use to separate them?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他用什么手段把他们俩拆开的？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam
smiling.  "He only told me what I have now told you."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">费茨威廉笑了笑说：“他并没有说明他用的是<BR>
什么手段，他讲给我听的，我刚才全部都讲给<BR>
你听了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling
with indignation.  After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam
asked her why she was so thoughtful.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白没有回答，继续往前走，她心里气透<BR>
了。费茨威廉望了她一下，问她为什么这样思<BR>
虑重重。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.
"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.  Why was
he to be the judge?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她说：“我在回想你刚才说给我听的话，我觉<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你认为他的干涉完全是多管闲事吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the
propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own
judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner
that friend was to be happy."  "But," she continued,
recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it
is not fair to condemn him.  It is not to be supposed that
there was much affection in the case."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我真不懂，达西先生有什么权利断定他朋友<BR>
的恋爱合适不合适；凭着他一个人的意思，他<BR>
怎么就能指挥他的朋友要怎样去获得幸福。”<BR>
她说到这里，便平了一下气，然后继续说下去<BR>
，“可是我们不明白其中的底细，那么，我们<BR>
要指责他，也就难免不公平。也许这一对男女<BR>
中间根本就，没有什么爱情。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it
is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这种推断倒不能说不合情理。”费茨威廉说<BR>
。“我表兄本来是一团高兴，给你这样一说，<BR>
他的功劳可要大大地打折扣啦。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a
picture of Mr. Darcy that she would not trust herself with an
answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation,
talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.
There, shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left
them, she could think without interruption of all that she had
heard.  It was not to be supposed that any other people could
be meant than those with whom she was connected.  There could
not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence.  That he had been concerned in the
measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never
doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the
principal design and arrangement of them.  If his own vanity,
however, did not mislead him, <I>he</I> was the cause, his pride and
caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and
still continued to suffer.  He had ruined for a while every
hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in
the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might
have inflicted.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他这句话本是说着打趣的，可是她倒觉得，这<BR>
句话正好是达西先生的一幅逼真的写照，她因<BR>
此不便回答，便突然改变了话题，尽谈些无关<BR>
紧要的事，边谈边走产觉来到了牧师住宅的门<BR>
前。客人一走，她就回到自己房里闭门独坐，<BR>
把刚才所听来的一番话仔细思量。他刚刚所提<BR>
到的那一对男女，一定跟她有关。世界上决不<BR>
可能有第二人会这样无条件服从达西先生。提<BR>
到用尽手段拆散彬格莱先生和吉英的好事，一<BR>
定少不了有他的份，她对于这一点从来不曾怀<BR>
疑过；她一向认为完全是彬格莱小姐的主意和<BR>
摆布。如果彬格莱先生本来并没有给虚荣心冲<BR>
昏头脑，那么，吉英目前所受的种种痛苦，以<BR>
及将来还要受下去的痛苦，都得归罪于他，归<BR>
罪于他的傲慢和任性。世界上一颗最亲切、最<BR>
慷慨的心，就这样让他一手把幸福的希望摧毁<BR>
得一干二净；而且谁也不敢说，他造下的这个<BR>
冤孽何年何月才能了结。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were
Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections
probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney,
and another who was in business in London.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这位小姐有些条件太不够格，”这是费茨威<BR>
廉上校说的；这些太不够格的条件也许就是指<BR>
她有个姨爹在乡下当律师，还有个舅舅在伦敦<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no
possibility of objection.  All loveliness and goodness as she
is!  Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her
manners captivating.  Neither could any thing be urged against
my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities
which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability
which he will probably never reach."  When she thought of her
mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections <I>there</I> had material weight with
Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a
deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's
connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite
decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst
kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley
for his sister.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她想到这里，不禁大声嚷了起来：“至于吉英<BR>
本身，根本就不可能有什么缺陷，她真是太可<BR>
爱太善良了──她见解高，修养好，风度又动<BR>
人，我父亲也没有什么可指摘的，他虽然有些<BR>
怪癖，可是他的能力是达西先生所不能藐视的<BR>
，说到他的品德，达西先生也许永远赶不上，<BR>
”当然，当她想到她母亲的时候，她的信心不<BR>
