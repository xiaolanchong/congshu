<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of
felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by
the arrival of Saturday.  The pain of separation, however,
might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the
reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope that shortly
after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be
fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.  He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before;
wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and
promised their father another letter of thanks.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">谈情说爱，筹划好事，就这样度过了一星期，<BR>
终于到了星期六，柯林斯先生不得不和心爱的<BR>
夏绿蒂告别。不过，他既已作好接新娘的准备<BR>
，离别的愁苦也就因此减轻了，他只等下次再<BR>
来哈福郡，订出佳斯，使他成为天下最幸福的<BR>
男子。他象上次一样隆重其事地告别了浪搏恩<BR>
的亲戚们，祝贺姐妹们健康幸福，又答应给他<BR>
们的父亲再来一封谢函。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of
receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend
the Christmas at Longbourn.  Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,
gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by
nature as education.  The Netherfield ladies would have had
difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and
within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred
and agreeable.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent,
elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn
nieces.  Between the two eldest and herself especially, there
subsisted a very particular regard.  They had frequently been
staying with her in town.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">下星期一，班纳特太太的弟弟和弟妇照例到浪<BR>
搏恩来过圣诞节，班纳特太太很是欣喜。嘉丁<BR>
纳先生是个通情达理、颇有绅士风度的人物，<BR>
无论在个性方面，在所受的教育方面，都高出<BR>
他姐姐很多。他原是出身商界，见闻不出货房<BR>
堆栈之外，竟会这般有教养，这般讨人喜爱，<BR>
要是叫尼日斐花园的太太小姐们看见了，实在<BR>
难以相信。嘉丁纳太太比班纳特太太以及腓力<BR>
普太太，都要小好几岁年纪，也是个和蔼聪慧<BR>
、而又很文雅的女人，浪搏恩的外甥女儿跟她<BR>
特别亲切。她们常常进城去在她那儿待一阵子<BR>
。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival, was
to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.
When this was done, she had a less active part to play.  It
became her turn to listen.  Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to
relate, and much to complain of.  They had all been very
ill-used since she last saw her sister.  Two of her girls had
been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳太太刚到这里，第一件事就是分发礼物<BR>
，讲述最时新的服装式样。这件事做过以后，<BR>
她便坐在一旁，静听班纳特太太跟她说话。班<BR>
纳特太太有多少牢骚要发，又有多少苦要诉。<BR>
自从上年她弟妇走了以后，她家里受了人家欺<BR>
负。两个女儿本来快要出嫁了，到头来只落得<BR>
一场空。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got
Mr. Bingley, if she could.  But, Lizzy!  Oh, sister!  it is
very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife
by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.  He
made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.  The
consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter
married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.  The Lucases are very artful people
indeed, sister.  They are all for what they can get.  I am
sorry to say it of them, but so it is.  It makes me very
nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to
have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.
However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of
comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long
sleeves."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我并不怪吉英，”她接下去说，“因为吉英<BR>
要是能够嫁给彬格莱先生，她早就嫁了。可是<BR>
丽萃──唉，弟妇呀！要不是她自己那么拗性<BR>
子，说不定她已做了柯林斯先生的夫人了。他<BR>
就在这间房子里向她求婚的，她却把他拒绝了<BR>
。结果倒让卢卡斯太太有个女儿比我的女儿先<BR>
嫁出去，浪搏恩的财产从此就得让人家来继承<BR>
。的确，卢卡斯一家手腕才高明呢，弟妇。他<BR>
们都是为了要捞进这一笔财产。我本来也不忍<BR>
心就这样编派他们，不过事实的确如此。我在<BR>
家里既然过得这样不称心，又偏偏碰到这些只<BR>
顾自己不顾别人的邻舍，真弄得我神经也坏了<BR>
，人也病了。你可来得正是时候，给了我极大<BR>
的安慰，我非常喜欢听你讲的那些……长袖子<BR>
的事情。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given
before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence
with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion
to her nieces, turned the conversation.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳太太远在跟吉英以及伊丽莎白通信的时<BR>
候，大体上就已经知道了她们家里最近发生的<BR>
这些事情，又为了体贴外甥女儿们起见，只稍<BR>
微敷衍了班纳特太太几句，便把这个话题岔开<BR>
了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the
subject.  "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for
Jane," said she.  "I am sorry it went off.  But these things
happen so often!  A young man, such as you describe
Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a
few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">后来伊丽莎白跟她两人在一起的时候，又谈到<BR>
了这件事。她说：“这倒也许是吉英的一门美<BR>
满亲事，只可惜吹了。可是这种情形往往是难<BR>
免！象你所说的彬格莱先生这样的青年，往往<BR>
不消几个星期的工夫，就会受上一位美丽的姑<BR>
娘，等到有一件偶然的事故把他们分开了，他<BR>
也就很容易把她忘了，这种见异思迁的事情多<BR>
的是。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it
will not do for <I>us</I>.  We do not suffer by accident.  It does
not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade
a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl,
whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你这样的安慰完全是出于一片好心，”伊丽<BR>
莎白说。“可惜安慰不了我们。我们吃亏并不<BR>
是吃在偶然的事情上面。一个独立自主的青年<BR>
，几天以前刚刚跟一位姑娘打得火热，现在遭<BR>
到了他自己朋友们的干涉，就把她丢了，这事<BR>
情倒不多见。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"But that expression of ``violently in love'' is so hackneyed,
so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an
half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.
Pray, how <I>violent</I> <I>was</I> Mr. Bingley's love?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不过，所谓‘打得火热’这种话未免太陈腐<BR>
，太笼统，太不切合实际，我简直抓不往一点<BR>
儿概念。这种话通常总是用来形容男女一见钟<BR>
情的场面，也用来形容一种真正的热烈感情。<BR>
请问，彬格莱先生的爱情火热到什么程度？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I never saw a more promising inclination.  He was growing
quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.
Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.  At
his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not
asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself without
receiving an answer.  Could there be finer symptoms?  Is not
general incivility the very essence of love?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我从来没有看见过象他那样的一往情深；他<BR>
越来越不去理会别人，把整个的心都放在她身<BR>
上。他们俩每见一次面，事情就愈显得明朗，<BR>
愈显得露骨。在他自己所开的一次跳舞会上，<BR>
他得罪了两三位年轻的小姐，没有邀请她们跳<BR>
舞；我找他说过两次话，他也没有理我。这还<BR>
不能算是尽心尽意吗？宁可为了一个人而得罪<BR>
大家，这难道不是恋爱场上最可贵的地方？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh, yes! -- of that kind of love which I suppose him to have
felt.  Poor Jane!  I am sorry for her, because, with her
disposition, she may not get over it immediately.  It had
better have happened to <I>you</I>, Lizzy; you would have laughed
yourself out of it sooner.  But do you think she would be
prevailed on to go back with us?  Change of scene might be of
service -- and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as
useful as anything."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢，原来如此！这样看来，他的确对她情深<BR>
意切。可怜的吉英！我真替她难受，照她的性<BR>
子看来，决不会一下子就把这件事情淡忘。丽<BR>
萃，要是换了你，倒要好些，你自会一笑置之<BR>
，要不了多少时候就会淡忘。不过，你看我们<BR>
能不能劝她到我们那里去稍往一阵？换换环境<BR>
也许会有好处；再说，离开了家，松口气，也<BR>
许比什么都好。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt
persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白非常赞成这个建议，而且相信姐姐也<BR>
会赞成。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with
regard to this young man will influence her.  We live in so
different a part of town, all our connections are so different,
and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very
improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to
see her."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳太太又说：“我希望她不要因为怕见到<BR>
这位青年小伙子而拿不定主意。我们虽然和彬<BR>
格莱先生同住在一个城里，可不住在同一个地<BR>
区，来往的亲友也不一样，而且，你知道得很<BR>
清楚，我们很少外出，因此，除非他上门来看<BR>
她，他们俩就不大可能见到面。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And <I>that</I> is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody
of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call
on Jane in such a part of London -- !  My dear aunt, how could
you think of it?  Mr. Darcy may perhaps have <I>heard</I> of such a
place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a
month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities,
were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never
stirs without him."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那是绝对不可能的，因为他现在被朋友们软<BR>
禁着，达西先生也不能容忍他到伦敦的这样一<BR>
个地区去看吉英！亲爱的舅母，你怎么会想到<BR>
这上面去了？达西先生也许听到过天恩寺街这<BR>
样一个地方，可是，如果他当真到那儿去一次<BR>
，他会觉得花上一个月的工夫也洗不净他身上<BR>
所染来的污垢；请你放心好了，他绝不会让彬<BR>
格莱先生单独行动。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"So much the better.  I hope they will not meet at all.  But
does not Jane correspond with the sister?  <I>She</I> will not be
able to help calling."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那就更好。我希望他们俩再也不要见面。可<BR>
是吉英不还晨跟他妹妹通信吗？彬格莱小姐也<BR>
许难免要来拜望呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“她绝不会跟她再来往了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to
place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of
Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a
solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination,
that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.  It was
possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his
affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his
friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of
Jane's attractions.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白虽然嘴上说得这么果断，认为彬格莱<BR>
先生一定被他的姐妹朋友挟住了，不会让他见<BR>
到吉英，这事情实在可笑，可是她心里想来想<BR>
去，还是觉得事情未必已经完全绝望。她有时<BR>
候甚至认为彬格莱先生非常可能对吉英旧情重<BR>
燃，他朋友们的影响也许敌不过吉英的感情所<BR>
加给他身上的天然影响。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and
the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time,
than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same
house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning
with her, without any danger of seeing him.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特小姐乐意地接受了舅母的邀请，她心里<BR>
并没有怎么想到彬格莱一家人，只希望珈罗琳<BR>
不和他哥哥同住一宅，那么她就可以偶而到珈<BR>
罗琳那儿去玩上一个上午，而不至于撞见他哥<BR>
哥。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the
Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day
without its engagement.  Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided
for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did
not once sit down to a family dinner.  When the engagement was
for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which
officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these
occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.  Without
supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in
love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make
her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on
the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her
the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳夫妇在浪搏恩待了一个星期，没有哪一<BR>
天不赴宴会，有时候在腓力普府上，有时候在<BR>
卢卡斯府上，不时候又在军官那儿。班纳特太<BR>
太小心周到地为她的弟弟和弟妇安排得十分热<BR>
闹，以致他们夫妇不曾在她家里吃过一顿便饭<BR>
。家里不宴会的日子，必定就有几位军官到场<BR>
，每次总是少不了韦翰。在这种场合下，伊丽<BR>
莎白总是热烈地赞扬韦翰先生，便利嘉丁纳太<BR>
太起了疑心，仔细注意起他们两人来，从她亲<BR>
眼看到的情形来说，她并不以为他们俩真正地<BR>
爱上了，不过相互之间显然已经发生了好感，<BR>
这叫她很是不安，她决定在离开哈福郡以前，<BR>
要把这件事和伊丽莎白谈个明白，并且要解释<BR>
给她听，让这样的关系发展下去，实在太莽撞<BR>
。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.  About ten or a dozen
years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable
time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged.
They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though
Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's
father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her
fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been
in the way of procuring.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">可是韦翰讨好起嘉丁纳太太来，另有一套办法<BR>
，这和他吸引别人的本领完全不同。远在十多<BR>
年以前嘉丁纳太太还没有结婚的时候，曾在德<BR>
比郡他所出生的那个地区住过好些时候，因此<BR>
她跟他有许多共同的朋友，虽说自从五年前达<BR>
西先生的父亲去世以后，韦翰就不大到那地方<BR>
去，可是他却能报道给嘉丁纳太太一些有关她<BR>
从前的朋友们的消息，比她自己打听得来的还<BR>
要新鲜。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy
by character perfectly well.  Here, consequently, was an
inexhaustible subject of discourse.  In comparing her
recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which
Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on
the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both
him and herself.  On being made acquainted with the present
Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something
of that gentleman's reputed disposition, when quite a lad,
which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she
recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken
of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳太太曾经亲眼看到过彭伯里，对于老达<BR>
西先生也是久闻大名，光是这件事，就是个谈<BR>
不完的话题。她把韦翰先生所详尽描写的彭伯<BR>
里和她自己记忆中的彭伯里比较了一下，又把<BR>
彭伯里主人的德行称赞了一番，谈的人和听的<BR>
人都各得其乐。她听到他谈起现在这位达西先<BR>
生对他的亏待，便竭力去回想那位先生小时候<BR>
的个性如何，是否和现在相符，她终于有自信<BR>
地记起了从前确实听人说过，费茨威廉・达西<BR>
先生是个脾气很坏又很高傲的孩子。<BR></TD>
