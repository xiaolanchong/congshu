Upper-Intermediate - Protest!  (D0018)  A:   This  is  Action  5  News  reporter  Sarah  O’Connell       reporting    live from   Washington,      D.  C.  where    a       protest has broken out.        Thousands of angry citi-       zens are protesting against the proposed bailout       of the auto manufacturing industry! Sir, sir, Sarah       O’Connell, Action 5 news.  Can you tell us what’s        happening?  B:   Yeah,  yeah,  we’re  here  because  we  feel  this  is       an  injustice!    The  ﬁnancial  irresponsibility  of  big       business  has  to  stop!      We’re  there  to  show  the       government that we don’t like the way that they’re       spending our tax dollars!  A:   Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry?  B:    It’s  an  absolute  outrage,  Sarah,  the  US  govern-        ment wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers’        money to the auto industry. These are companies       that have been mismanaged and are now nearly       bankrupt.  A:    I see.   But, many supporters of the bailout argue        that it could help save the jobs of millions of hard-        working Americans.  B:    That maybe true, and I for one don’t want to see        anyone  lose  their  job,  but  how  can  these  CEOs        ask for a bailout when they’re making millions of        dollars?    And  then,  they  have  the  nerve  to  ﬂy  to        Washington in  private  jets!        This  costs  hundreds        of  thousands  of  dollars!       And  they’re  asking  for        money! That is just not right!  A:    Good point. This is Sarah O’Connell reporting live        from Washington D. C., back to you, Tom. Key Vocabulary  protest                           Noun   (sin-         an  event  where  people                                    gular)               gather together to show                                                         disapproval    of  some-                                                         thing  break out                         Verb,                start suddenly                                    Present                                    Perfect
