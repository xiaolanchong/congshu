and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the
invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the
evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room.  The
loo table, however, did not appear.  Mr. Darcy was writing, and
Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his
letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to
his sister.  Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.
Hurst was observing their game.

amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his
companion.  The perpetual commendations of the lady either
on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on
the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with
which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue,
and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.

sometimes an indirect boast."

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"The indirect boast; -- for you are really proud of your
defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding
from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which
if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The
power of doing any thing with quickness is always much
prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the
imperfection of the performance.  When you told Mrs. Bennet
this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort
of panegyric, of compliment to yourself -- and yet what is
there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very
necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage
to yourself or any one else?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“要算是转弯抹角的自夸，因为你对于你自己<BR>
写信方面的缺点觉得很得意，你认为你思想敏<BR>
捷，懒得去注意书法，而且你认为你这些方面<BR>
即使没有什么了不起，完全不考虑到做出来的<BR>
成绩是不是完美。你今天早上跟班纳特太太说<BR>
，如果你决定要从尼日斐花园搬走，你五分钟<BR>
之内就可以搬走，这种话无非是夸耀自己，恭<BR>
维自己。再说，急躁的结果只会使得应该要做<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night
all the foolish things that were said in the morning.  And yet,
upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true,
and I believe it at this moment.  At least, therefore, I did
not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to
show off before the ladies."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“得了吧，”彬格莱先生嚷道，“晚上还记起<BR>
早上的事，真是太不值得。而且老实说，我相<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced
that you would be gone with such celerity.  Your conduct would
be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and
if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,
``Bingley, you had better stay till next week,'' you would
probably do it, you would probably not go -- and, at another
word, might stay a month."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting
what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my
temper.  But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that
gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think
the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a
flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱说：“我真太高兴了，我的朋友所说的<BR>
话，经你这么一圆转，反面变成恭维我的话了<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call
mine, but which I have never acknowledged.  Allowing the case,
however, to stand according to your representation, you must
remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to
desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has
merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in
favour of its propriety."

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the
influence of friendship and affection.  A regard for the
requester would often make one readily yield to a request
without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.  I am not
particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about
Mr. Bingley.  We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his
behaviour thereupon.  But in general and ordinary cases between
friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to
change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think
ill of that person for complying with the desire, without
waiting to be argued into it?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“达西先生，我觉得你未免否定了友谊和感情<BR>

such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should
not pay him half so much deference.  I declare I do not know a

over some music books that lay on the instrument, how
frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.  She hardly
knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration
to so great man; and yet that he should look at her because he
disliked her was still more strange.  She could only imagine
however, at last, that she drew his notice because there was a
something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to
his ideas of right, than in any other person present.  The
supposition did not pain her.  She liked him too little to care
for his approbation.

可不大敢存这种奢望，不过，要是说达西是因<BR>
为讨厌她所以才望着她，那就更说不通了。最<BR>

了一些活泼的苏格兰曲子来变换变换情调。不<BR>
大一会儿工夫，达西先生走到伊丽莎白跟前来<BR>
，跟她说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize
such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“班纳特小姐，你是不是很想趁这个机会来跳<BR>
一次苏格兰舞？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She smiled, but made no answer.  He repeated the question, with
some surprise at her silence.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白没有回答他，只是笑了笑。他见她闷<BR>
声不响，觉得有点儿奇怪，便又问了她一次。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not
immediately determine what to say in reply.  You wanted me,
I know, to say ``Yes,'' that you might have the pleasure of
despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing
those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their
premeditated contempt.  I have therefore made up my mind to
tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all -- and
now despise me if you dare."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢，”她说，“我早就听见了；可是我一下<BR>
子拿不准应该怎样回答你。当然，我知道你希<BR>
望我回答一声‘是的’那你就会蔑视我的低级<BR>
趣味，好让你自己得意一番，只可惜我一向喜<BR>
欢戳穿人家的诡计，作弄一下那些存心想要蔑<BR>
视人的人。因此，我决定跟你说，我根本不爱<BR>
跳苏格兰舞；这一下你可不敢蔑视我了吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Indeed I do not dare."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“果真不敢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed
at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and
archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to
affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any
woman as he was by her.  He really believed, that were it not
for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some
danger.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白本来打算使他难堪一下，这会儿见他<BR>
那么体贴，倒楞住了。不过，伊丽莎白的为人<BR>
一贯温柔乖巧，不轻易得罪任何人，而达西又<BR>
对她非常着迷，以前任何女人也不曾使他这样<BR>
着迷过。他不由得一本正经地想道，要不是她<BR>
的亲戚出身微贱，那我难免危险了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her
great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received
some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱小姐见到这般光景，很是嫉妒，或者也<BR>
可以说是她疑心病重，因此由疑而妒。于是她<BR>
愈想把伊丽莎白撵走，就愈巴不得她的好朋友<BR>
吉英病体赶快复元。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by
talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness
in such an alliance.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">为了挑拨达西厌恶这位客人，她常常闲言闲语<BR>
，说他跟伊丽莎白终将结成美满良缘，而且估<BR>
料着这一门良缘会给达西带来多大幸福。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the
shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a
few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the
advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do
cure the younger girls of running after the officers. -- And,
if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that
little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which
your lady possesses."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">第二天彬格莱小姐跟达西两人在矮树林里散步<BR>
，彬格莱小姐说：“我希望将来有一天好事如<BR>
愿的时候，你得委婉地奉劝你那位岳母出言吐<BR>
语要谨慎些，还有你那几位小姨子，要是你能<BR>
力办得到，最好也得把她们那种醉心追求军官<BR>
的毛病医治好。还有一件事，我真不好意思说<BR>
出口；尊夫人有一点儿小脾气，好象是自高自<BR>
大，又好象是不懂礼貌，你也得尽力帮助她克<BR>
制一下。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“关于促进我的家庭幸福方面，你还有什么别<BR>
的意见吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  yes. -- Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt
Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.  Put them next
to your great uncle, the judge.  They are in the same
profession, you know; only in different lines.  As for your
Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢，有的是。千万把你姨丈人姨丈母的像挂<BR>
到彭伯里画廊里面去，就挂在你那位当法官的<BR>
伯祖父大人遗象旁边。你知道他们都是同行，<BR>
只不过部门不同而已。至于尊夫人伊丽莎白，<BR>
可千万别让别人替她画像，天下哪一个画家能<BR>
够把她那一双美丽的眼睛画得维妙维肖？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but
their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine,
might be copied."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那双眼睛的神气确不容易描画；可是眼睛的<BR>
形状和颜色，以及她的睫毛，都非常美妙，也<BR>
许描画得出来。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst
and Elizabeth herself.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他们正谈得起劲和时候，忽然看见赫斯脱太太<BR>
和伊丽莎白从另外一条路走过来。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley,
in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱小姐连忙招呼她们说：“我不知道你们<BR>
也想出来散散步，”她说这话的时候，心里很<BR>
有些惴惴不安，因为她恐怕刚才的话让她们听<BR>
见了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "in running
away without telling us that you were coming out."  Then taking
the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by
herself.  The path just admitted three.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你们也太对不起我们了，”赫斯脱太太回答<BR>
道，“只顾自己出来，也不告诉我们一声。”<BR>
接着她就挽住达西空着的那条臂膀，丢下伊丽<BR>
莎白，让她独个儿去走。这条路恰巧只容得下<BR>
三个人并排走。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said, --
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西先生觉得她们太冒味了，便说道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"This walk is not wide enough for our party.  We had better go
into the avenue."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这条路太窄，不能让我们大家一块儿并排走<BR>
，我们不是走到大道上去吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with
them, laughingly answered,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白本不想跟他们待在一起，一听这话，<BR>
便笑嘻嘻地说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"No, no; stay where you are. -- You are charmingly group'd, and
appear to uncommon advantage.  The picturesque would be spoilt
by admitting a fourth.  Good bye."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不用啦，不用啦；你们就在这儿走走吧。你<BR>
们三个人在一起走非常好看，而且很出色。加<BR>
上第四个人，画面就给弄毁了。再见。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the
hope of being at home again in a day or two.  Jane was already
so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of
hours that evening.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">于是她就得意洋洋地跑开了。她一面跪溜达，<BR>
一面想到一两天内就可以回家，觉得很高兴。<BR>
吉英的病已经大为好转，当天晚上就想走出房<BR>
间去玩它两个钟头。<BR></TD>
