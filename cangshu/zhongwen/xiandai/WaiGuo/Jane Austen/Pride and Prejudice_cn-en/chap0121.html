<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end,
and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable
feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some
peevish allusion of her mother.  As for the gentleman himself,
his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or
dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of
manner and resentful silence.  He scarcely ever spoke to her,
and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss
Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable
relief to them all, and especially to her friend.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">关于柯林斯先生求婚问题的，讨论差不多就要<BR>
结束了，现在伊丽莎白只感到一种照例难免的<BR>

说到那位先生本人，他可并不显得意气沮丧，<BR>
也没有表现出要回避她的样子，只是气愤愤地<BR>
板着脸，默然无声。他简直不跟她说话，他本<BR>
来的那一股热情，到下半天都转移到卢卡斯小<BR>
姐身上去了。卢小姐满有礼貌地听着他说话，<BR>
这叫大家都松了口气，特别是她的朋友。<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill humour or
ill health.  Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry
pride.  Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten
his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by
it.  He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he
still meant to stay.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太直到第二天还是同样不高兴，身体<BR>

傲慢的样子。伊丽莎白原以为他这样一气，就<BR>

来的计划，他讲她要到星期六才走，便决定要<BR>
待到星期六。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if
Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from
the Netherfield ball.  He joined them on their entering the
town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and
vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked
over. -- To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吃过早饭，小姐们上麦里屯去打听韦翰先生回<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better
not meet Mr. Darcy; -- that to be in the same room, the same
party with him for so many hours together, might be more than
I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more
than myself."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他说：“当时日期一天天迫近，我心里想，还<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a
full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they
civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer
walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he
particularly attended to her.  His accompanying them was a
double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to
herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of
introducing him to her father and mother.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她非常赞美他的涵养功夫。当韦翰和另一位军<BR>
官跟她们一块儿回浪博恩来的时候，一路上他<BR>
特别照顾她，因此他们有充分的空暇来讨论这<BR>
个问题，而且还客客气气地彼此恭维了一阵。<BR>
他所以要伴送她们，是为了两大利益；一来可<BR>
以让她高兴高兴，二来可以利用这个大好机会<BR>
，去认识认识她的双亲。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet;
it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.  The
envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed
paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and
Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it,
and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away,
tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general
conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject
which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner
had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
invited her to follow her up stairs.  When they had gained
their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她们刚回到家里，班纳特小姐就接到一封从尼<BR>
日斐花园寄来的信。信立刻拆开了，里面装着<BR>
一张小巧、精致、熨烫得很平滑的信笺，字迹<BR>
是出自一位小姐的娟秀流利的手笔。伊丽莎白<BR>
看到姐姐读信时变了脸色，又看到她全神贯注<BR>
在某几段上面。顷该之间，吉英又镇静了下来<BR>
，把信放在一旁，象平常一样，高高兴兴地跟<BR>
大家一起聊天；可是伊丽莎白仍然为这件事焦<BR>
急，因此对韦翰也分心了。韦翰和他的同伴一<BR>
走，吉英便对她做了个眼色，叫她跟上楼去。<BR>
一到了她们自己房里，吉英就拿出信来，说道<BR>
：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised
me a good deal.  The whole party have left Netherfield by this
time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention
of coming back again.  You shall hear what she says."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这是另罗琳・彬格莱写来的，信上的话真叫<BR>
我大吃一惊。她们一家人现在已经离开尼日斐<BR>
花园上城里去了，再也不打算回来了。你看看<BR>
她怎么说的吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the
information of their having just resolved to follow their
brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day
in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.  The next was
in these words.  "I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall
leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;
but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns
of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and
most unreserved correspondence.  I depend on you for that."  To
these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the
insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their
removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament;
it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield
would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of
their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to
regard it, in the enjoyment of his.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">于是她先把第一句念出来，那句话是说，她们<BR>
已经决定，立刻追随她们的弟兄上城里去，而<BR>
且要在当天赶到格鲁斯汶纳街吃饭，原来赫斯<BR>
脱先生就住在那条街上。接下去是这样写的：<BR>
──“亲爱的朋友，离开哈福德郡，除了你的<BR>
友谊以外，我真是一无留恋，不过，我希望将<BR>
来有一天，还是可以象过去那样愉快地来往，<BR>
并希望目前能经常通信，无话不谈，以抒离悃<BR>
。临笔不胜企盼。”伊丽莎白对这些浮话奢词<BR>
，亦只是姑妄听之；虽说她们这一次突然的迁<BR>
走叫她感到惊奇，可是她并不觉得真有什么可<BR>
以惋惜的地方。她们离开了尼日斐花园，未必<BR>
彬格莱先生便不会再在那儿住下去；至于说到<BR>
跟她们没有了来往，她相信吉英只要跟彬格莱<BR>
先生时常见面，也就无所谓了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you
should not be able to see your friends before they leave the
country.  But may we not hope that the period of future
happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive
earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse
you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? -- Mr. Bingley will not be detained
in London by them."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">歇了片刻，伊丽莎白说道：“不幸得很，你朋<BR>
友们临走以前，你没有来得及去看她们一次。<BR>
可是，彬格莱小姐既然认为将来还有重聚的欢<BR>
乐，难道我们不能希望这一天比她意料中来得<BR>
早一些吗？将来做了姑嫂，不是比今天做朋友<BR>
更满意吗？彬格莱先生不会被她们久留在伦敦<BR>
的。”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return
into Hertfordshire this winter.  I will read it to you -- "
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“咖罗琳肯定地说，她们一家人，今年冬天谁<BR>
也不会回到哈福郡来了。让我念给你听吧：”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the
business which took him to London, might be concluded in three
or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the
same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be
in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following
him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant
hours in a comfortless hotel.  Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my
dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd,
but of that I despair.  I sincerely hope your Christmas in
Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season
generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to
prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall
deprive you."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">‘我哥哥昨天和我们告别的时候，还以为他这<BR>
次上伦敦去，只要三四天就可以把事情办好；<BR>
可是我们认为办不到，同时我们相信，查尔斯<BR>

踪前去，免得他冷冷清清住在旅馆里受罪。我<BR>
很多朋友都上伦敦去过冬了；亲爱的朋友，我<BR>
本来还希望听到你进城去的消息，结果我失望<BR>

own master.  But you do not know <I>all</I>.  I <I>will</I> read you the
passage which particularly hurts me.  I will have no reserves
from <I>you</I>."  "Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to
confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her
again.  I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for
beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she
inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something
still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister.  I do not know whether I ever
before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will
not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you
will not esteem them unreasonable.  My brother admires her
greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of
seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish
the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is
not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of
engaging any woman's heart.  With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my
dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will
secure the happiness of so many?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你为什么这样想法？那一定是他自己的意思<BR>

去看看他妹妹；说老实话，我们也差不多同样<BR>
热切地希望和她重逢。我以为乔治安娜・达西<BR>
无论在容貌方面，举止方面，才艺方面，的确<BR>
再也没有人能够比得上。露薏莎和我都大胆地<BR>
希望她以后会做我们的嫂嫂，因此我们对她便<BR>
越发关切了。我不知道以前有没有跟你提起过<BR>
我对这件事的感觉，可是当此离开乡村之际，<BR>
我不愿意不把这些感觉说出来，我相信你不会<BR>
觉得这是不合理的吧。我的哥哥已经深深地受<BR>
上了她，他现在可以时常去看她，他们自会更<BR>
加亲密起来；双方的家庭方面都同样盼望这门<BR>
亲事能够成功。我想，如果我说，查尔斯最善<BR>
于博取任何女人的欢心，这可不能是出于做姐<BR>
妹的偏心，瞎说一阵吧。既是各方面都赞成这<BR>
段姻缘，而且事情毫无阻碍，那么，最亲爱的<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"What think you of <I>this</I> sentence, my dear Lizzy?" -- said
Jane as she finished it.  "Is it not clear enough? -- Does it
not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes
me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her
brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of
my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my
guard?  Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"

<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“非常愿意。”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You shall have it in few words.  Miss Bingley sees that her
brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and
tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Jane shook her head.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英摇摇头。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. -- No one who has ever
seen you together, can doubt his affection.  Miss Bingley I am
sure cannot.  She is not such a simpleton.  Could she have seen
half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have
ordered her wedding clothes.  But the case is this.  We are not
rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more
anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less
trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some
ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh
were out of the way.  But, my dearest Jane, you cannot
seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her
brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of <I>your</I> merit than when he took leave of
you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him
that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love
with her friend."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“吉英，你的确应该相信我。凡是看见过你们<BR>
俩在一起的人，都还会怀疑到他的感情。我相<BR>
信彬格莱小姐也不会怀疑，她不是那么一个傻<BR>
瓜。要是她看到达西先生对她的爱有这样的一<BR>
半，她就要办嫁妆了。可是问题是这样的：在<BR>
她们家里看来，我们还不够有钱，也不够有势<BR>
，她所以急于想把达西小姐配给她哥哥，原来<BR>
还有一个打算，那就是说，亲上加亲以后，亲<BR>
上再加亲就更省事了。这件事当然很费了一些<BR>
心机，我敢说，要不是德・包尔小姐从中作梗<BR>
，事情是会成功的。可是最亲爱的吉英，你千<BR>
万不要因为彬格莱小姐告诉你说，她哥哥已经<BR>
深深地爱上了达西小姐，你就以为彬格莱先生<BR>
自从星期二和你分别以来，对你的倾心有丝毫<BR>

而去爱上她那位女朋友。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.  But I
know the foundation is unjust.  Caroline is incapable of
wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this
case is, that she is deceived herself."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“假如我对彬格莱小姐看法是一致的，”吉英<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"That is right. -- You could not have started a more happy

his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of

<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那就得看你自己的主张如何，”伊丽莎白说<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the
utmost contempt.  It appeared to her merely the suggestion of
Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment
suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,
could influence a young man so totally independent of every
one.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">所谓他不会回来，这种想法伊丽莎白大不以为<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she
felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its
happy effect.  Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was
gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection
sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to
Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她把自己对这个问题的感想，解释给她姐姐听<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure
of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the
gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave
her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly
unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they
were all getting so intimate together.  After lamenting it
however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at
Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable
declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family
dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.
