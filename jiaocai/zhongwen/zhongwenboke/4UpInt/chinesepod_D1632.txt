Upper-Intermediate - Noodles and Child Labor

(D1632)

A:

牛肉炒拉面，谁叫的？

niúròu chǎo lāmiàn, shéi jiào de?

Stir-fried beef noodles. Who ordered them?

B:

哦。是我。八块钱，是吧？

ò. shì wǒ. bā kuài qián, shì ba?

Oh. That's me. It's 8 kuai, right?

A:

嗯。再见！

ng4. zàijiàn!

Yeah. Bye!

B:

哎，怎么又是这个小孩来送外卖？他都不读书，不上学吗？

āi, zěnme yòu shì zhè ge xiǎohái lái sòng wàimài? tā dōu bù dúshū, bù shàngxué ma?

Hey. How come that kid delivered the food again? He doesn't study or go to school?

C:

看他样子应该有八九岁了吧，按理说应该到了上学的年龄了。可能是店里生意太好，他父母忙不过来，就让他帮忙送一下吧。

kàn tā yàngzi yīnggāi yǒu bā jiǔ suì le ba, ànlǐshuō yīnggāi dào le shàngxué de niánlíng le. kěnéng shì diàn lǐ shēngyì tài hǎo, tā fùmǔ máng bu guòlái, jiù ràng tā bāngmáng sòng yīxià ba.

He looks like he's about 8 or 9 years old, so he should be old enough to go to school. Maybe the restaurant is doing really well and his parents can't handle all the work so they have him help with deliveries.

B:

啊？他还是个孩子，怎么能叫他干活呢？这样做不是在雇佣童工吗？

ǎ? tā hái shì ge háizi, zěnme néng jiào tā gànhuó ne? zhèyàng zuò bùshì zài gùyōng tónggōng ma?

Huh? He's still a kid. How can they have him work? Wouldn't this mean his parents are using child labor?

C:

雇佣童工？这个说法太严重了。雇佣童工可是犯法，要坐牢的。要是知道的话，肯定不会叫他干活了。而且他父母叫他干活也不会付他工钱。

gùyōng tóng gōng? zhè ge shuōfa tài yánzhòng le. gùyōng tóng gōng kěshì fànfǎ, yào zuòláo de. yàoshì zhīdào dehuà, kěndìng bùhuì jiào tā gànhuó le. érqiě tā fùmǔ jiào tā gànhuó yě bùhuì fù tā gōngqián.

Child labor? That's a pretty serious way of putting it. Child labor is against the law. You'll go to prison for it. If they knew that, they definitely wouldn't have him work. Also, if his parents have him work they aren't going to pay him.

B:

那他为什么要干活？他这么小，应该去学校上学，跟同学们玩。这是他的权利，父母不能干涉。

nà tā wèishénme yào gànhuó? tā zhème xiǎo, yīnggāi qù xuéxiào shàngxué, gēn tóngxué men wán. zhè shì tā de quánlì, fùmǔ bùnéng gānshè.

Then why does he have to work? He's so young. He should go to school and play with his friends. That's his right. His parents can't interfere with that.

C:

估计他父母都没受过什么教育，哪懂这些。可能就以为反正孩子闲着也是闲着，帮忙干干活还能少雇个工人，多赚点钱。而且那孩子好像还挺乐意的。上次我去他们店里吃面的时候，有个客人叫他小老板，他还乐呵呵的。

gūjì tā fùmǔ dōu méi shòu guo shénme jiàoyù, nǎ dǒng zhèxiē. kěnéng jiù yǐwéi fǎnzhèng háizi xián zhe yě shì xián zhe, bāngmáng gàn gan huó hái néng shǎo gù ge gōngrén, duō zhuàn diǎnr qián. érqiě nà háizi hǎoxiàng hái tǐng lèyì de. shàngcì wǒ qù tāmen diàn lǐ chī miàn de shíhou, yǒu ge kèrén jiào tā xiǎo lǎobǎn, tā hái lèhēhē de.

I bet his parents were never educated. How can they understand all of this? Maybe they just think he's going to be hanging around anyway, if he helps out they can hire one less person and earn some extra money. Also, that kid seems like he really enjoys it. Last time I ate noodles at the restaurant a customer called him 'little boss' and he loved it.

B:

哎！这些孩子太可怜了，从小就被灌输这种无知的思想。连个快乐的童年都没有。

āi! zhèxiē háizi tài kělián le, cóngxiǎo jiù bèi guànshū zhèzhǒng wúzhī de sīxiǎng. lián ge kuàilè de tóngnián dōu méiyǒu.

Agh! What a poor kid. From a young age he's already been imbued with such an ignorant way of thinking. He doesn't even get to have a happy childhood.

C:

呵呵，慢慢来吧！这种思想也不是一天两天就能改变的。社会在进步，他们总有一天也会进步的。

hēhē, mànmān lái ba! zhèzhǒng sīxiǎng yě bù shì yītiān liǎngtiān jiù néng gǎibiàn de. shèhuì zài jìnbù, tāmen zǒng yǒu yī tiān yě huì jìnbù de.

Heh-heh. Take it easy! This kind of thinking can't be changed in a day or two. Society is making progress. Someday they'll make progress too.
