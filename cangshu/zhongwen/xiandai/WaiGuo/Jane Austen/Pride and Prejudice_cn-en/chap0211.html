<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate
herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her
employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had
written to her since her being in Kent.  They contained no
actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past
occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.  But in
all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and
which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with
itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been
scarcely ever clouded.  Elizabeth noticed every sentence
conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had
hardly received on the first perusal.  Mr. Darcy's shameful
boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings.  It was some
consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on
the day after the next, and a still greater that in less than a
fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to
contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection
could do.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白等柯林斯夫妇走了以后，便把她到肯<BR>
特以来所收到吉英的信，全都拿出来一封封仔<BR>
细阅读，好象是为了故意要跟达西做冤家做到<BR>
底似的。信上并没有写什么真正埋怨的话，既<BR>
没有提起过去的事情，也没有诉说目前的。痉<BR>
她素性娴静，心肠仁爱，因此她的文笔从来不<BR>
带一些阴暗的色彩，总是欢欣鼓舞的心情跃然<BR>
纸上，可是现在，读遍了她所有的信，甚至读<BR>
遍了她每一封信的字里行间，也找不出这种欢<BR>
欣的笔调。伊丽莎白只觉得信上每一句话都流<BR>
露着不安的心情，因为她这一次是用心精读的<BR>
，而上一次她却读得很马虎，所以没有注意到<BR>
这种地方。达西先生恬不知耻地夸口说，叫人<BR>
家受罪是他的拿手好戏，这使她愈发深刻地体<BR>
会到姐姐的痛苦。她在达西后天就要离开罗新<BR>
斯，她总算可以稍觉安慰，而更大的安慰是，<BR>
不到两个星期，她又可以和吉英在一起了，而<BR>
且可以用一切感情的力量去帮助她重新振作起<BR>
精神来。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering
that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had
made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable
as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">一想起达西就要离开肯特，便不免记起了他的<BR>
表兄弟也要跟着他一起走；可是费茨威廉已经<BR>
表明他自己决没有什么意图，因此，他虽然挺<BR>
叫人喜欢，她却不至于为了他而不快活。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound
of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by
the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once
before called late in the evening, and might now come to
enquire particularly after her.  But this idea was soon
banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when,
to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were
better.  She answered him with cold civility.  He sat down for
a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room.
Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.  After a silence
of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner,
and thus began,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她正在转着这种念头，突然听到门铃响，她以<BR>
为是费茨威廉来了，心头不由得跳动起来，因<BR>
为他有一天晚上就是来得很晚的这回可能是特<BR>
地来问候她。但是她立刻就知道猜错了，出乎<BR>
她的意料，走进屋来的是达西先生，于是她情<BR>
绪上又是另一种感觉。他立刻匆匆忙忙问她身<BR>
体好了没有，又说他是特地来听她复元的好消<BR>
息的。她客客气气地敷衍了他一下。他坐了几<BR>
分钟，就站起身来，在房间里踱来踱去。伊丽<BR>
莎白心里很奇怪，可是嘴上一言未发。沉默了<BR>
几分钟以后，他带着激动的神态走到她跟前说<BR>
：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"In vain have I struggled.  It will not do.  My feelings will
not be repressed.  You must allow me to tell you how ardently
I admire and love you."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我实在没有办法死捱活撑下去了。这怎么行<BR>
。我的感情也压制不住了。请允许我告诉你，<BR>
我多么敬慕你，多么爱你。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.  She stared,
coloured, doubted, and was silent.  This he considered
sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt
and had long felt for her immediately followed.  He spoke well,
but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be
detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of
tenderness than of pride.  His sense of her inferiority -- of
its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which
judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with
a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding,
but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白真是说不出的惊奇。她瞪着眼，红着<BR>
脸，满腹狐疑，闭口不响。他生看这情形，便<BR>
认为她是在怂恿他讲下去，于是立刻把目前和<BR>
以往对她的种种好感全都和盘托出。他说得很<BR>
动听，除了倾诉爱情以外，又把其他种种感想<BR>
也源源本本说出来了。他一方面千言万语地表<BR>
示深情密意，但是另一方面却又说了许许多多<BR>
傲慢无礼的话。他觉得她出身低微，觉得自己<BR>
是迁就她，而且家庭方面的种种障碍，往往会<BR>
使他的见解和他的心愿不能相容并存──他这<BR>
样热烈地倾诉，虽然显得他这次举动的慎重，<BR>
却未必能使他的求婚受到欢迎。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be
insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and
though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at
first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to
resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion
in anger.  She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him
with patience, when he should have done.  He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in
spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to
conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be
rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.  As he said this, she
could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.
He <I>spoke</I> of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance
expressed real security.  Such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into
her cheeks, and she said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">尽管她对他的厌恶之心根深蒂固，她究竟不能<BR>
对这样一个男人的一番盛情，漠然无动于中；<BR>
虽说她的意志不曾有过片刻的动摇，可是她开<BR>
头倒也体谅到他将会受到痛苦，因此颇感不安<BR>
，然而他后来的那些话引起了她的怨恨，她那<BR>
一片怜惜之心便完全化成了愤怒。不过，她还<BR>
是竭力镇定下来，以便等他把话说完，耐心地<BR>
给他一个回答。未了，他跟她说，他对她的爱<BR>
情是那么强烈，尽管他一再努力克服，结果还<BR>
是克服不了，他又向她表明自己的希望，说是<BR>
希望她表接受他的求婚。她一下子就看出他说<BR>
这些话的时候，显然自认为她毫无问题会给他<BR>
满意的回答。他虽然口里说他自己又怕又急，<BR>
可是表情上却是一副万无一失的样子。这只有<BR>
惹起她更加激怒；等他讲完话以后，她就红着<BR>
脸说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode
to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed,
however unequally they may be returned.  It is natural that
obligation should be felt, and if I could <I>feel</I> gratitude,
I would now thank you.  But I cannot -- I have never desired
your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most
unwillingly.  I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will
be of short duration.  The feelings which, you tell me, have
long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have
little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“遇到这一类的事情，通常的方式是这样的：<BR>
人家对你一片好心好意，你即使不能给以同样<BR>
的报答，也得表示一番感激，我现在就得向你<BR>
表示谢意。可惜我没有这种感觉。我从来不稀<BR>
罕你的抬举，何况你抬举我也是十分勉强。我<BR>
从来不愿意让任何人感到痛苦，纵使惹得别人<BR>
痛苦，也是根本出于无心，而且我希望很快就<BR>
会事过境迁。你跟我说，以前你顾虑到种种方<BR>
面，因此没有能够向我表明你对我的好感，那<BR>
么，现在经过我这番解释之后，你一定很容易<BR>
把这种好感克制下来。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his
eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less
resentment than surprise.  His complexion became pale with
anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every
feature.  He was struggling for the appearance of composure,
and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have
attained it.  The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西先生本是斜倚在壁炉架上，一双眼睛盯住<BR>
了她看，听到她这番话，好象又是气愤又是惊<BR>
奇。他气得脸色铁青，从五官的每一个部位都<BR>
看得出他内心的烦恼。他竭力装出镇定的样子<BR>
，一直等到自以为已经装象了，然后才开口说<BR>
话。这片刻的沉默使伊丽莎白心里非常难受。<BR>
最后达西才勉强沉住了气说道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of
expecting!  I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so
little <I>endeavour</I> at civility, I am thus rejected.  But it is
of small importance."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我很荣幸，意得到你这样一个回答！也许我<BR>
可以请教你一下，为什么我竟会遭受到这样没<BR>
有礼貌的拒绝？不过这也无关紧要。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why, with so evident a
design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that
you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even
against your character?  Was not this some excuse for
incivility, if I <I>was</I> uncivil?  But I have other provocations.
You know I have.  Had not my own feelings decided against you,
had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do
you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the
man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我也可以请问一声，”她回答道，“为什么<BR>
你明明白白存心要触犯我，侮辱我，嘴上却偏<BR>
偏要说什么为了喜欢我，意违背了你自己的意<BR>
志，违背了你自己的理性，甚至违背了你自己<BR>
的性格？要是我果真没有礼貌，那么，这还不<BR>
够作为我没有礼貌的理由吗？可是我还有别的<BR>
气恼。你也知道我有的，就算我对你没有反感<BR>
，就算我对你毫无芥蒂，甚至就算我对你有好<BR>
感吧，那么请你想一想，一个毁了我最亲爱的<BR>
姐姐幸福，甚至永远毁了她的幸福的人，怎么<BR>
会打动我的心去爱他呢？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but
the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to
interrupt her while she continued.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西先生听了她这些话，脸色大变；不过这种<BR>
感情的激动，只有一会儿这过去了，他听着她<BR>
继续说下去，一些不想打岔。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.  No
motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted
<I>there</I>.  You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the
principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each
other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice
and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed
hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我有足够的理由对你怀着恶感。你对待那件<BR>
事完全无情无义，不论你是出于什么动机，都<BR>
叫人无可原谅。说起他们俩的分离，即使不是<BR>
你一个人造成的，也是你主使的，这你可不敢<BR>
否认，也不能否认。你使得男方被大家指责为<BR>
朝三暮四，使女方被大家嘲笑为奢望空想，你<BR>
叫他们俩受尽了苦痛。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was
listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any
feeling of remorse.  He even looked at her with a smile of
affected incredulity.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她说到这里，只见他完全没有一点儿悔恨的意<BR>
思，真使她气得非同小可。他甚至还假装出一<BR>
副不相信的神气在微笑。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你能否认你这样做过吗？”她又问了一遍。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of
denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my
friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.
Towards <I>him</I> I have been kinder than towards myself."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他故作镇静地回答道：“我不想否认。我的确<BR>
用心了一切办法，拆散了我朋友和你姐姐的一<BR>
段姻缘；我也不否认，我对自己那一次的成绩<BR>
觉得很得意。我对他总算比对我自己多尽了一<BR>
份力。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil
reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely
to conciliate, her.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白听了他这篇文雅的调整词令，表面上<BR>
并不愿意显出很注意的样子。这番话的用意她<BR>
当然明白，可是再也平息不了她的气愤。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my
dislike is founded.  Long before it had taken place, my opinion
of you was decided.  Your character was unfolded in the recital
which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.  On this
subject, what can you have to say?  In what imaginary act of
friendship can you here defend yourself?  or under what
misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不过，我还不止在这一件事情上面厌恶你，<BR>
”她继续说道，“我很早就厌恶你，对你有了<BR>
成见。她几个月以前听了韦翰先生说的那些话<BR>
，我就明白了你的品格。这亻事你还有什么可<BR>
说的？看你再怎样来替你自己辩护，把这件事<BR>
也异想天开地说是为了维护朋友？你又将怎么<BR>
样来颠倒是非，欺世盗名？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said
Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西先生听到这里，脸色变得更厉害了，说话<BR>
的声音也不象刚才那么镇定，他说：“你对于<BR>
那位先生的事的确十分关心。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help
feeling an interest in him?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“凡是知道他的不幸遭遇的人，谁能不关心他<BR>
？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his
misfortunes have been great indeed."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他的不幸遭遇！”达西轻蔑地重说了一遍。<BR>
“是的，他的确太不幸啦。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy.  "You
have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative
poverty.  You have withheld the advantages, which you must know
to have been designed for him.  You have deprived the best
years of his life, of that independence which was no less his
due than his desert.  You have done all this!  and yet you can
treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这都是你一手造成的，”伊丽莎白使劲叫道<BR>
。“你害得他这样穷──当然并不是太穷。凡<BR>
是指定由他享有的利益，你明明知道，却不肯<BR>
给他。他正当年轻力壮，应该独立自主，你却<BR>
剥夺了他这种权利。这些事都是你做的，可是<BR>
人家一提到他的不幸，你还要鄙视和嘲笑。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across
the room, "is your opinion of me!  This is the estimation in
which you hold me!  I thank you for explaining it so fully.  My
faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!  But
perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards
her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your
pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that
had long prevented my forming any serious design.  These bitter
accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater
policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the
belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed
inclination -- by reason, by reflection, by every thing.  But
disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.  Nor am I ashamed of
the feelings I related.  They were natural and just.  Could you
expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这就是你对我的看法！”达西一面大声叫嚷<BR>
，一面向屋子那头走去。“你原来把我看成这<BR>
样的一个人！谢谢你解释得这样周到。这样看<BR>
来，我真是罪孽孽深重！不过，”他止住了步<BR>
，转过身来对她说：“只怪我老老实实地把我<BR>
以前一误再误、迟疑不决的原因说了出来，所<BR>
以伤害了你自尊心，否则你也许就不会计较我<BR>
得罪你的这些地方了。要是我耍一点儿手段，<BR>
把我内心矛盾掩藏起来，一昧恭维你，叫你相<BR>
信我无论在理智方面、思想方面、以及种种方<BR>
面，都是对你怀着无条件的、纯洁的爱，那么<BR>
，你也许就不会有这些苛刻的责骂了。可惜无<BR>
论是什么样的装假，我都痛恨。我刚才所说出<BR>
的这些顾虑，我也并不以为可耻。这些顾虑是<BR>
自然的，正确的。难道你指望我会为你那些微<BR>
贱的亲戚而欢欣鼓舞吗？难道你以为，我要是<BR>
攀上了这么些社会地位远不如我的亲戚，倒反<BR>
而会自己庆幸吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she
tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白愈来愈忿怒，然而她还是尽量平心静<BR>
气地说出了下面这段话：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of
your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it
spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you,
had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“达西先生，倘若你有礼貌一些，我拒绝了你<BR>
以后，也许会觉得过意不去，除此以外，倘若<BR>
你以为这样向我表白一下，会在我身上起别的<BR>
作用，那你可想错了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she
continued,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他听到这番话，吃了一惊，可是没有说什么，<BR>
于是她又接着说下去：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any
possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你用尽一切办法，也不能打动我的心，叫我<BR>
接受你的求婚。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with
an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.  She
went on.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他又显出很惊讶的样子，他带着痛苦和诧异的<BR>
神气望着她。她继续说下去：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost
say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me
with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and
your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to
form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding
events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known
you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the
world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“从开头认识你的时候起，几乎可以说，从认<BR>

我对你不满的原因就在这里，以后又有了许许<BR>
多多事情，使我对你深恶痛绝；我还没有认识<BR>
你一个月，就觉得象你这样一个人，哪怕天下<BR>
男人都死光了，我也不愿意嫁给你。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You have said quite enough, madam.  I perfectly comprehend
your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own
have been.  Forgive me for having taken up so much of your
time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你说得够了，小姐，我完全理解你的心情，<BR>
现在我只有对我自己那些顾虑感到羞耻。请原<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth
heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the
house.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他说了这几句话，便匆匆走出房间。隔了一忽<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.  She knew not
how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and
cried for half an hour.  Her astonishment, as she reflected on
what had passed, was increased by every review of it.  That she
should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!  that he
should have been in love with her for so many months!  so much
in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections
which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister,
and which must appear at least with equal force in his own
case, was almost incredible!  It was gratifying to have
inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.  But his pride,
his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done
with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in
acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the
unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had
for a moment excited.
