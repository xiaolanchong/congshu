<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the
parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add
considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings.
It was some days, however, before they received any invitation
thither, for while there were visitors in the house they could
not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week
after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such
an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church
to come there in the evening.  For the last week they had seen
very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.  Colonel
Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during
the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">费茨廉的风度大受牧师家里人的称道，女眷们<BR>
都觉得他会使罗新斯宴会平添不少情趣。不过<BR>

请，因为主人家有了客人，用不着他们了；一<BR>
直到复活节那一天，也就是差不多在这两位贵<BR>
宾到达一星期以后，他们才蒙受到被邀请的荣<BR>
幸，那也不过是大家离开教堂时，主人家当面<BR>
约定他们下午去玩玩而已。上一个星期他们简<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour
they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing room.  Her
ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their
company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get
nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her
nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than
to any other person in the room.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他们当然都接受了邀请，准时到达了咖苔琳夫<BR>

房间里任何人都说得多。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing
was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's
pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.  He now
seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and
Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books
and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well
entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so
much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady
Catherine herself as well as of Mr. Darcy.  <I>His</I> eyes had been
soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of
curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the
feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple
to call out,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">倒是费茨廉上校见到他们好象很高兴；因为罗<BR>
新斯的生活实在单调无味，他很想要有点调剂<BR>

喜欢。他就坐到她身边去，那么有声有色地谈<BR>
到肯特郡，谈到哈福德郡，谈到旅行和家居，<BR>
谈到新书和音乐，直谈得伊丽莎白感觉到在这<BR>
个房间里从来没有受到过这样的款待；他们俩<BR>
谈得那么兴致淋漓，连咖苔琳夫人和达西先生<BR>
也注意起来了。达西的一对眼睛立刻好奇地一<BR>
遍遍在他们俩身上打溜转；过了一会儿工夫，<BR>
夫人也有了同感，而且显得更露骨，她毫不犹<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?  What is it you are
talking of?  What are you telling Miss Bennet?  Let me hear
what it is."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able
to avoid a reply.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我们谈谈音乐，姨母，”费茨廉上校迫不得<BR>
已地回答了一下。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Of music!  Then pray speak aloud.  It is of all subjects my
delight.  I must have my share in the conversation, if you are
speaking of music.  There are few people in England, I suppose,
who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better
natural taste.  If I had ever learnt, I should have been a
great proficient.  And so would Anne, if her health had allowed
her to apply.  I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.  How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“谈音乐！那么请你们说得响一些吧。我最喜<BR>
爱音乐。要是你们谈音乐，就得有我的份儿。<BR>
我想，目前在英国，没有几个人能象我一样真<BR>
正欣赏音乐，也没有人比我趣味更高。我要是<BR>
学了音乐，一定会成为一个名家。安妮要是身<BR>

奏起来，一定动人。乔治安娜，现在学得怎么<BR>
样啦，达西？”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's
proficiency.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西先生极其恳切地把自己妹妹的成就赞扬了<BR>
一番。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady
Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect
to excel, if she does not practise a great deal."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“听到她弹得这样好，我真高兴，”咖苔琳夫<BR>
人说：“请你替我告诉她，要是她不多多练习<BR>
，那她也好不到哪里去。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such
advice.  She practises very constantly."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“姨母，你放心吧，”达西说，“她用不着你<BR>
这样的劝告。她经常在练习。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"So much the better.  It cannot be done too much; and when I
next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any
account.  I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in
music is to be acquired, without constant practice.  I have
told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really
well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no
instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to
come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano forte in
Mrs. Jenkinson's room.  She would be in nobody's way, you know,
in that part of the house."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那就更好。练习总不怕太多，我下次有空写<BR>
信给她，一定要嘱咐她无论如何不得偷懒。我<BR>
常常告诉年轻的小姐们说，要上想在音乐上出<BR>
人头地，就非要经常练习不可。我已经告诉班<BR>
纳特小姐好几次，除非她再多练习练习，她永<BR>
远不会好到哪里去；我常常对她说，柯林斯太<BR>
太那里虽然没有琴，我却很欢迎她每天到罗新<BR>
斯来，在姜金生太太房间里那架钢琴上弹奏。<BR>
你知道，在那间房间里，她不会妨碍什么人的<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding,
and made no answer.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西先生看到姨母这种无礼的态度，觉得有些<BR>
丢脸，因此没有去理她。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of
having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to
the instrument.  He drew a chair near her.  Lady Catherine
listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her
other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving
with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte, stationed
himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance.  Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">喝过了咖啡，费茨廉上校提醒伊丽莎白说，她<BR>
刚刚答应过弹琴给，于是她马上坐到琴边去。<BR>
他拖过一把椅子来坐在她身旁。咖苔琳夫人听<BR>
了半支歌，便象刚才那样又跟这一位姨侄谈起<BR>
话来，直谈得这位姨侄终于避开了她，从容不<BR>
迫地走到钢琴跟前站住，以便把演奏者的美丽<BR>
的面貌看个清楚明白。伊丽莎白看出了他的用<BR>
意，便趁机住手，回过头来对他娇媚地一笑，<BR>
说道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this
state to hear me?  But I will not be alarmed though your sister
<I>does</I> play so well.  There is a stubbornness about me that
never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.  My
courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“达西先生，你这样走过来听，莫不是想吓唬<BR>
我？尽管你妹妹的确演奏得很好，我也不怕。<BR>
我性子倔强，决不肯让别人把我吓倒。人家越<BR>
是想来吓倒我，我的胆子就越大。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because
you could not really believe me to entertain any design of
alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance
long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in
occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your
own."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西说：“我决不会说你讲错了，因为你不会<BR>
真以为我存心吓你；好在我认识你很久了，知<BR>
道你就喜欢说一些并不是你自己心里想说的话<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said
to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very
pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able
to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had
hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.  Indeed,
Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you
knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and, give me leave
to say, very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to
retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your
relations to hear."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白听到人家这样形容她，便高兴地笑了<BR>
起来，于是对费茨廉说道：“你表兄竟在你面<BR>
前把我说成一个多糟糕的人教你对我的话一句<BR>
也不要相信。我真晦气，我本来想在这里骟骗<BR>
人，叫人相信我多少有些长处，偏偏碰上了一<BR>
个看得穿我真正性格的人。──真的，达西先<BR>
生，你把我在哈福德郡的一些倒霉的事儿都一<BR>
股脑儿说了出来，你这是不厚道的──而且，<BR>
请允许我冒昧说一句，你这也是不聪明的──<BR>
因为你这样做，会引起我的报复心，我也会说<BR>
出一些事来，叫你的亲戚们听了吓一跳。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我才不怕你呢，”他微笑持说。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried
Colonel Fitzwilliam.  "I should like to know how he behaves
among strangers."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">费茨威廉连忙叫道：“我倒要请你说说看，他<BR>
有什么不是。我很想街道他跟陌生人一起的时<BR>
候，行为怎么样。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You shall hear then -- but prepare yourself for something very
dreadful.  The first time of my ever seeing him in
Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball -- and at this
ball, what do you think he did?  He danced only four dances!
I am sorry to pain you -- but so it was.  He danced only four
dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of
a partner.  Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那么我就讲给你听吧；我先得请你不要骇怕<BR>
。你得明白，我第一次在哈福德郡看见他，是<BR>
在一个舞会上，你知道他在这个跳舞会上做些<BR>
什么？他一共只跳了四次舞！我不愿意叫你听<BR>
了难受，不过事实确是这样。虽说男客很少，<BR>
他却只跳了四次，而且我知道得很清楚，当时<BR>
在场的女客中间，没有舞伴而闲坐在一旁的可<BR>
不止一个人呢──达西先生，你可不能否认有<BR>
这件事哟。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the
assembly beyond my own party."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“说来遗憾，当时舞场上除了我自己人以外，<BR>
一个女客也不认识。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?  My fingers
wait your orders."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不错；跳舞场里是不作兴请人家介绍女朋友<BR>
的。──唔，费茨威廉上校，再叫我弹什么呢<BR>
？我的手指在等着你吩咐。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had
I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend
myself to strangers."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西说：“也许我当时最好请人介绍一下，可<BR>
是我又不配去向陌生人自我推荐。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth,
still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.  "Shall we ask him why a
man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is
ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我们要不要问问你的表兄，这究竟是什么缘<BR>
故？”伊丽莎白仍然对着费茨威廉上校说话。<BR>
“我们要不要问问他，一个有见识、有阅历、<BR>
而又受过教育的人，为什么不配把自己介绍给<BR>
陌生人？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without
applying to him.  It is because he will not give himself the
trouble."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">费茨威廉说：“我可以回答你的问题，用不着<BR>
请教他。那是因为他自己怕麻烦。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,"
said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen
before.  I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear
interested in their concerns, as I often see done."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西说：“我的确不象人家那样有本领，遇到<BR>
向来不认识的人也能任情谈笑。我也不会象人<BR>
家那样随声附和，假意关切。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument
in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.  They
have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the
same expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my
own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of
practising.  It is not that I do not believe <I>my</I> fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白说：“我谈起钢琴来，手指不象许多<BR>
妇女那么有气派，也不象她们那么有力和灵活<BR>
，也没有她们弹得那么有表情。我一直认为这<BR>
是我自己的缺点，是我自己不肯用功练习的缘<BR>
故。我可不信我的手指不及那些比我弹奏得高<BR>
明的女人。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Darcy smiled, and said, "You are perfectly right.  You have
employed your time much better.  No one admitted to the
privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.  We
neither of us perform to strangers."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西笑了笑说：“你说得完全对。可见你的成<BR>
绩要她得多。凡是有福份听过你演奏的人，都<BR>
觉得你毫无欠缺的地方。我们两人可就不愿意<BR>
在陌生人面前表演。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to
know what they were talking of.  Elizabeth immediately began
playing again.  Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening
for a few minutes, said to Darcy,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">说到这里，咖苔琳夫人大声地问他们谈些什么<BR>
，打断了他们的话。伊丽莎白立刻重新弹起琴<BR>
来。咖苔琳夫人走近前来，听了几分钟以后，<BR>
就对达西说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised
more, and could have the advantage of a London master.  She has
a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal
to Anne's.  Anne would have been a delightful performer, had
her health allowed her to learn."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“班纳特小姐如果再多练习练习，能够请一位<BR>
伦敦名师指点指点，弹起来就不会有毛，病了<BR>
。虽说她的趣味比不上安妮，可是她很懂得指<BR>
法。安妮要是身体好，能够学习的话，一定会<BR>
成为一位令人满意的演奏者。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to
his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any
other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole
of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for
Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry
<I>her</I>, had she been his relation.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白望着达西，要看看他听了夫人对他表<BR>
妹的这番夸奖，是不是竭诚表示赞同，可是当<BR>
场和事后都看不出他对她有一丝一毫爱的迹象<BR>
、从他对待德・包尔小姐的整个态度看来，她<BR>
不禁替彬格莱小姐感到安慰：要是彬格莱小姐<BR>
跟达西是亲戚的话，达西一定也会跟她结婚。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's
performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution
and taste.  Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of
civility; and at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the
instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them
all home.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">咖苔琳夫人继续对伊丽莎白的演奏发表意见，<BR>
还给了她许多关于演奏和鉴赏方面的指示。伊<BR>
丽莎白只得极有忍耐地虚心领教。她听从了丙<BR>
位男客的要求，一直坐在钢琴旁边，弹到夫人<BR>
备她了马车送他们大家回家。<BR></TD>
