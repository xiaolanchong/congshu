<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with
their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and
Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most
steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins
at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure
of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham
had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the
house.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">年轻的小姐们跟她们姨妈的约会，并没有遭受<BR>
到反对。柯林斯只觉得来此作客，反而把班纳<BR>
特夫妇整晚丢在家里，未免有些过意不去，可<BR>
是他们叫他千万不要放在心上。于是他和他的<BR>
五个表妹便乘着马车，准时到了麦里屯。小姐<BR>
们一走进客厅，就听说韦翰先生接受了她们姨<BR>
爹的邀请，而且已经驾到，觉得很是高兴。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When this information was given, and they had all taken their
seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and
admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture
of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have
supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at
Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what
Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened
to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's
drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost
eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment,
and would hardly have resented a comparison with the
housekeeper's room.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">大家听到这个消息之后，便都坐了下来。柯林<BR>
斯先生悠闲自在地朝四下望望，瞻仰瞻仰一切<BR>
；屋子的尺寸和里面的家具使他十分惊羡，他<BR>
说他好象进了咖苔琳夫人在罗新斯的那间消夏<BR>
的小饭厅。这个比喻开头并不怎么叫主人家满<BR>
意，可是接下来腓力普太太弄明白了罗新斯是<BR>
一个什么地方，它的主人是谁，又听他说起咖<BR>
苔琳夫人的一个会客间的情形，光是一只壁炉<BR>
架就要值八百英镑，她这才体会到他那个譬喻<BR>
实在太恭维她了，即使把她家里比作罗新斯管<BR>
家奶奶的房间，她也不反对了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her
mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own
humble abode and the improvements it was receiving, he was
happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found
in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his
consequence increased with what she heard, and who was
resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she
could.  To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and
who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and
examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the
mantlepiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.  It
was over at last however.  The gentlemen did approach; and when
Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had
neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with
the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.  The officers
of the -----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present
party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person,
countenance, air, and walk, as <I>they</I> were superior to the
broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who
followed them into the room.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">柯林斯在讲述咖苔琳夫人和她公馆的富丽堂皇<BR>
时，偶然还要穿插上几句话，来夸耀他自己的<BR>
寒舍，说他的住宅正在装璜改善中等，他就这<BR>
样自得其乐地一直扯到男客们进来为止，。他<BR>
发觉腓力普太太很留心听他的话，她愈听就愈<BR>
把他看得了不起，而且决定一有空就把他的话<BR>
传播出去。至于小姐们，实在觉得等得太久了<BR>
，因为她们不高兴听她们表兄的闲扯，又没事<BR>
可做，想弹弹琴又不成，只有照着壁炉架上那<BR>
些瓷器的样子，漫不经心地画些小玩艺儿消遗<BR>
消遗。等待的时间终于过去了男客们来了。韦<BR>
翰先生一走进来，伊丽莎白就觉得，无论是上<BR>
次看见他的时候也好，从上次见面以来想起他<BR>
的时候也好，她都没有错爱了他。某某郡的军<BR>
官们都是一批名誉很好的绅士气派的人物，参<BR>
加这次宴会的尤其是他们之中的精华。韦翰先<BR>
生无论在人品上，相貌上，风度上，地位上，<BR>
都远远超过他们，正如他们远远超过那位姨爹<BR>
一样──瞧那位肥头大耳，大腹便便的姨爹，<BR>
他正带着满口葡萄酒味，跟着他们走进屋来。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female
eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he
finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he
immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its
being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season,
made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare
topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the
speaker.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">韦翰先生是当天最得意的男子，差不多每个女<BR>
人的眼睛都朝着他看；伊丽莎白是当天最得意<BR>
的女子，韦翰终于在她的身旁坐了下来。他马<BR>
上就跟她攀谈，虽然谈的只是些当天晚上下雨<BR>
和雨季可能就要到来之类的话，可是他那么和<BR>
颜悦色，使她不禁感觉到即使最平凡、最无聊<BR>
、最陈旧的话，只要说话的人有技巧，还是一<BR>
样可以说得动听。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and
the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into
insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing;
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips,
and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with
coffee and muffin.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">说起要博得女性的表眼，柯林斯先生遇到象韦<BR>
翰先生和军官们这样的劲敌，真变得无足轻重<BR>
了。他在小姐们眼睛里实在算不上什么，幸亏<BR>
好心的腓力普太太有时候还听听他谈主，她又<BR>
十分细心，尽量把咖啡和松饼敬给他吃。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity
of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">一张张牌桌摆好以后，柯林斯便坐下来一同玩<BR>
“惠斯脱”总算有了一个机会报答她的好意。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall
be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life --"
Mrs. Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could
not wait for his reason.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他说：“我对这玩艺儿简直一窍不通，不过我<BR>
很愿意把它学会，以我这样的身份来说──”<BR>
腓力普太太很感激他的好意可是却不愿意听他<BR>
谈论什么身份地位。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was
he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.  At
first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely
for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise
extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much
interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming
after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very
willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she
could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with
Mr. Darcy.  She dared not even mention that gentleman.  Her
curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.  Mr. Wickham began
the subject himself.  He inquired how far Netherfield was from
Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an
hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">韦翰先生没有玩“惠斯脱”，因为他被小姐们<BR>
高高兴兴地请到另一张桌子上去玩牌，坐在伊<BR>
丽莎白和丽迪雅之间。开头的形势很叫人担忧<BR>
，因为丽迪雅是个十足的健谈家，大有把他独<BR>
占下来的可能；好在她对于摸奖也同样爱好，<BR>
立刻对那玩艺儿大感兴趣，一股劲儿下注，得<BR>
奖之后又大叫大嚷，因此就无从特别注意到某<BR>
一个人身上去了。韦翰先生一面跟大家应付这<BR>
玩艺儿，一面从容不迫地跟伊丽莎白谈话。伊<BR>
丽莎白很愿意听他说话，很想了解一下他和达<BR>
西先生过去的关系，可是她要听的他未必肯讲<BR>
。于是她提也不敢提到那位先生。后来出人意<BR>
料之外，韦翰先生竟自动地谈到那个问题上去<BR>
了。因此她的好奇心到底还是得到了满足。韦<BR>
翰先生问起尼日斐花园离开麦里屯有多远。她<BR>
回答了他以后，他又吞吞吐吐地问起达西先生<BR>
已经在那儿待了多久。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let
the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property
in Derbyshire, I understand."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白说：“大概有一个月了。”为了不愿<BR>
意让这个话题放松过去，她又接着说：“据我<BR>
所知，他是德比郡一个大财主。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes," replied Wickham; -- "his estate there is a noble one.
A clear ten thousand per annum.  You could not have met with
a person more capable of giving you certain information on
that head than myself -- for I have been connected with his
family in a particular manner from my infancy."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“是的，”韦翰回答道。“他的财产很可观─<BR>
─每年有一万镑的净收入。说起这方面，谁也<BR>
没有我知道得确实，因为我从小就和他家里有<BR>
特别的关系。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白不禁显出诧异的神气。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,
after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of
our meeting yesterday. -- Are you much acquainted with
Mr. Darcy?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“班纳特小姐，你昨天也许看到我们见面时那<BR>
种冷冰冰的样子了吧，难怪你听了我的话会觉<BR>
得诧异。你同达西先生很熟吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly, --
"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I
think him very disagreeable."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我也只希望跟他这么熟就够了，”伊丽莎白<BR>
冒火地叫道。“我和他在一起待了四天，觉得<BR>
他很讨厌。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I have no right to give <I>my</I> opinion," said Wickham, "as to
his being agreeable or otherwise.  I am not qualified to form
one.  I have known him too long and to well to be a fair judge.
It is impossible for <I>me</I> to be impartial.  But I believe your
opinion of him would in general astonish -- and perhaps you
would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. -- Here
you are in your own family."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">韦翰说：“他究竟讨人喜欢还是讨人厌，我可<BR>
没有权利说出我的意见。我不便发表意见。我<BR>
认识他太久，跟他也处得太熟，因此很难做个<BR>
公正的判断人。我不可能做到大公无私。不过<BR>
我敢说，你对他的看法大致可以说是骇人听闻<BR>
的，或许你在别的地方就不会说得这样过火吧<BR>
。这儿都是你自己人呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Upon my word I say no more <I>here</I> than I might say in any
house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.  He is not at
all liked in Hertfordshire.  Every body is disgusted with his
pride.  You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any
one."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“老实说，除了在尼日斐花以外，我到附近任<BR>
何人家去都会这样说。哈福德郡根本就没有人<BR>
喜欢他。他那副傲慢的气派，哪一个见了都讨<BR>
厌。你绝不会听到人家说他一句好话。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated
beyond their deserts; but with <I>him</I> I believe it does not
often happen.  The world is blinded by his fortune and
consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners,
and sees him only as he chooses to be seen."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">歇了一会儿，韦翰说：“说句问心无愧的话，<BR>
不管是他也好，是别人也好，都不应该受到人<BR>
家过分的抬举。不过他这个人，我相信不大会<BR>
有人过分抬举他的。他的有钱有势蒙蔽了天下<BR>
人的耳目，他那目空一切、盛气凌人的气派又<BR>
吓坏了天下人，弄得大家只有顺着他的心意去<BR>
看待他。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I should take him, even on <I>my</I> slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man."  Wickham only shook his head.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我虽然跟他并不太熟，可是我认为他是个脾<BR>
气很坏的人。”韦翰听了这话，只是摇头。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,
"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">等到有了说话的机会，他又接下去说：“我不<BR>
知道他是否打算在这个村庄里多住些时候。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I do not at all know; but I <I>heard</I> nothing of his going away
when I was at Netherfield.  I hope your plans in favour of the
----shire will not be affected by his being in the
neighbourhood."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我完全不知道；不过，我在尼日斐花园的时<BR>
候，可没有听说他要走。你既然喜欢某某郡，<BR>
打算在那里工作，我但愿你不要因为他在附近<BR>
而影响了你原来的计划。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  no -- it is not for <I>me</I> to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.
If <I>he</I> wishes to avoid seeing <I>me</I>, he must go.  We are not
on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but
I have no reason for avoiding <I>him</I> but what I might proclaim
to all the world; a sense of very great ill-usage, and most
painful regrets at his being what he is.  His father, Miss
Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever
breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never
be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to
the soul by a thousand tender recollections.  His behaviour
to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could
forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his
disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his
father."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢，不；我才不会让达西先生赶走呢。要是<BR>
他不愿意看到我，那就得他走。我们两个人的<BR>
交情搞坏了，我见到他就不好受，可是我没有<BR>
理由要避开他，我只是要让大家知道他是怎样<BR>
亏待了我，他的为人处世怎样使我痛心。班纳<BR>
特小姐，他那去世的父亲，那位老达西先生，<BR>
却是天下最好心的人，也是我生平最最真心的<BR>
朋友；每当我同现在这位达西先生在一起的时<BR>
候就免不了逗起千丝万缕温存的回忆，从心底<BR>
里感到苦痛。他对待我的行为真是恶劣万分；<BR>
可是我千真万确地相信，我一切都能原谅他，<BR>
只是不能容忍他辜负他先人的厚望，辱没他先<BR>
人的名声。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and
listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented
farther inquiry.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白对这件事越来越感到兴趣，因此听得<BR>
很专心。但是这件事很蹊跷，她不便进一步追<BR>
问。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all
that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially,
with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">韦翰先生又随便谈了些一般的事情。他谈到麦<BR>
里屯，谈到四邻八舍和社交之类的事，凡是他<BR>
所看到的事情，他谈起来都非常欣喜，特别是<BR>
谈到社交问题的时候，他的谈吐举止更显得温<BR>
雅殷勤。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he
added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.
I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my
friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their
present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent
acquaintance Meryton had procured them.  Society, I own, is
necessary to me.  I have been a disappointed man, and my
spirits will not bear solitude.  I <I>must</I> have employment and
society.  A military life is not what I was intended for, but
circumstances have now made it eligible.  The church <I>ought</I>
to have been my profession -- I was brought up for the church,
and I should at this time have been in possession of a most
valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking
of just now."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他又说：“我所以喜爱某某郡，主要是为了这<BR>
儿的社交界都是些上等人，又讲交情，我又知<BR>
道这支部队名声很好，受到大家爱护，加上我<BR>
的朋友丹尼为了劝我上这儿来，又讲起他们目<BR>
前的营房是多么好，麦里屯的众对待他们又多<BR>
么殷勤，他们在麦里屯又结交了多少好朋友。<BR>
我承认我是少不了社交生活的。我是个失意的<BR>
人。精神上受不了孤寂。我一定要有职业和社<BR>
交生活。我本来不打算过行伍生活，可是由于<BR>
环境所迫，现在也只好去参加军队了。我本应<BR>
该做牧师的，家里的意思本来也是要培养我做<BR>
牧师；要是我博得了我们刚刚谈到的这位先生<BR>

俸禄呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Indeed!"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“是吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes -- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation
of the best living in his gift.  He was my godfather, and
excessively attached to me.  I cannot do justice to his
kindness.  He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had
done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“怎么会不是！老达西先生遗嘱上说明，牧师<BR>
职位一有了最好的空缺就给我。他是我的教父<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could <I>that</I> be? --
How could his will be disregarded? -- Why did not you seek
legal redress?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“天哪！”伊丽莎白叫道；“怎么会有那种事<BR>

依法申诉？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest
as to give me no hope from law.  A man of honour could not have
doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to
treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert
that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance,
imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.  Certain it is, that
the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an
age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having
really done any thing to deserve to lose it.  I have a warm,
unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my
opinion <I>of</I> him, and <I>to</I> him, too freely.  I can recall
nothing worse.  But the fact is, that we are very different
sort of men, and that he hates me."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“遗嘱上讲到遗产的地方，措辞很含混，因此<BR>
我未必可以依法申诉。照说，一个要面子的人<BR>
是不会怀疑先人的意图的；可是达西先生偏偏<BR>
要怀疑，或者说，他认为遗嘱上也只是说明有<BR>
条件地提拔我，他硬要说我浪费和荒唐，因此<BR>
要取消我一切的权利。总而言之，不说则已，<BR>
说起来样样坏话都说到了。那个牧师位置居然<BR>
在两年前空出来了，那正是我够年龄掌握那份<BR>
俸禄的那年，可是却给了另一个人。我实在无<BR>
从责备我自己犯了什么过错而活该失掉那份俸<BR>
禄，除非说我性子急躁，心直口快，有时候难<BR>
免在别人面前说他几句直话，甚至还当面顶撞<BR>
他。也不过如此而已。只不过我们完全是两样<BR>

the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention
his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were

the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr.
Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips,
protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at
