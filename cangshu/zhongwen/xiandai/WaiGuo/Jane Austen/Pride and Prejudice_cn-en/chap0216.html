<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">It was the second week in May in which the three young
ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street for the town of
---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn
where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly
perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty
and Lydia looking out of a dining room upstairs.  These two
girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in
visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard,
and dressing a salad and cucumber.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">五月已经到了第二个星期，三位年轻小姐一块<BR>
儿从天恩寺街出发，到哈德福郡的某某镇去，<BR>
班纳特先生事先就跟她们约定了一个小客店，<BR>
打发了马车在那儿接她们，刚一到那儿，她们<BR>
就看到吉蒂和丽迪雅从楼上的餐室里望着她们<BR>
，这表明车夫已经准时到了。这两位姑娘已经<BR>
在那儿待了一个多钟头，高高兴兴地光顾过对<BR>
面的一家帽子店，看了看站岗的哨兵，又调制<BR>
了一些胡瓜色拉。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a
table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually
affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice?  is not this an
agreeable surprise?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她们欢迎了两位姐姐之后，便一面得意洋洋地<BR>
摆出一些菜来（都是小客店里常备的一些冷盆<BR>
），一面嚷道：“这多么好？你们想也没有想<BR>
到吧？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend
us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out
there."  Then showing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought
this bonnet.  I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I
might as well buy it as not.  I shall pull it to pieces as soon
as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">丽迪雅又说：“我们存心做东道，可是要你们<BR>
借钱给我们，我们自己的钱都在那边铺子里花<BR>
光了。”说到这里，她便把买来的那些东西拿<BR>
给她们看。“瞧，我买了这顶帽子。我并不觉<BR>
得太漂亮；可是我想，买一顶也好。一到家我<BR>
就要把它拆开来重新做过，你们看我会不会把<BR>
它收拾得好一些。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh!  but there were two or three much uglier in the
shop; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to
trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.
Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer
after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a
fortnight."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">姐姐们都说她这顶帽子很难看，她却毫不在乎<BR>
地说：“噢，那家铺子里还有两三顶，比这一<BR>
顶还要难看得多；待我去买点儿颜色漂亮的缎<BR>
子来，把它重新装饰一下，那就过得去了。再<BR>
说，某某郡的民兵团，两星期之内就要开走了<BR>
，他们一离开麦里屯之后，夏季随便你穿戴些<BR>
什么都无所谓。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest
satisfaction.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他们就要开走了，真的吗？”伊丽莎白极其<BR>
满意地嚷道。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want
papa to take us all there for the summer!  It would be such a
delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at
all.  Mamma would like to go too, of all things!  Only think
what a miserable summer else we shall have!"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他们就要驻扎到白利屯去；我真希望爸爸带<BR>
我们大家到那儿去消暑！这真是个妙透了的打<BR>
算，或许还用不着花钱。妈妈也一定非要去不<BR>
可！你想，否则我们这一个夏天多苦闷呀！”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "<I>that</I> would be a delightful scheme,
indeed, and completely do for us at once.  Good Heaven!
Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been
overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the
monthly balls of Meryton."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“话说得是，”伊丽莎白想道；“这真是个好<BR>
打算，马上就会叫我们忙死了。老天爷啊！光<BR>
是麦里屯一个可怜的民兵团和每个月开几次跳<BR>
舞会，就弄得我们神魂颠倒了，怎么当得起白<BR>
利屯和那整营的官兵！”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat
down to table.  "What do you think?  It is excellent news,
capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">大家坐定以后，丽迪雅说：“现在我有点儿消<BR>
息要报告你们，你们猜猜看是什么消息？这是<BR>
个好透了的消息，头等重要的消息，说的是关<BR>
于我们大家都喜欢的某一个人。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was
told that he need not stay.  Lydia laughed, and said, "Aye,
that is just like your formality and discretion.  You thought
the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!  I dare say he often
hears worse things said than I am going to say.  But he is an
ugly fellow!  I am glad he is gone.  I never saw such a long
chin in my life.  Well, but now for my news: it is about dear
Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?  There is no
danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.  There's for you!  She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.  Wickham
is safe."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英和伊丽莎白面面相觑，便打发那个堂倌走<BR>
开。于是丽迪雅笑笑说：“嘿，你们真是太规<BR>
矩小心。你们以为一定不能让堂倌听到，好象<BR>
他存心要听似的！我相信他平常听到的许多话<BR>
，比我要说的这番话更是不堪入耳。不过他是<BR>
个丑八怪！他走开了，我倒也高兴。我生平没<BR>
有见到过他那样长的下巴。唔，现在我来讲新<BR>
闻啦───这是关于可爱的韦翰的新闻；堂倌<BR>
不配听，是不是？韦翰再不会有跟玛丽・金结<BR>
婚的危险了──真是个了不起的消息呀！那位<BR>
姑娘上利物浦她叔叔那儿去了──一去不回来<BR>
了。韦翰安全了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a
connection imprudent as to fortune."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“应该说玛丽・金安全了！”伊丽莎白接着说<BR>
，“她总算逃过了一段冒失的姻缘。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“要是她喜欢他而又走开，那真是个大傻瓜呢<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,"
said Jane.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我但愿他们双方的感情都不十分深，”吉英<BR>
说。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am sure there is not on <I>his</I>.  I will answer for it he
never cared three straws about her.  Who <I>could</I> about such a
nasty little freckled thing?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我相信他这方面的感情不会深的。我可以担<BR>
保，他根本就没有把她放在心上。谁看得上这<BR>
么一个满脸雀班的讨厌的小东西？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of <I>expression</I> herself, the coarseness of the
<I>sentiment</I> was little other than her own breast had formerly
harboured and fancied liberal!
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白心想，她自己固然决不会有这样粗卤<BR>
的谈吐，可是这种粗卤的见解，正和她以前执<BR>
迷不悟的那种成见一般无二，她想到这里，很<BR>
是惊愕。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage
was ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with
all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome
addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吃过了饭，姐姐们回了帐，便吩咐着手准备马<BR>
车；经过了好一番安排，几位小姐，连带自己<BR>
的箱子、针线袋、包裹、以及吉蒂和丽迪雅所<BR>
买的那些不受欢迎的东西，总算都放上了马车<BR>
。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.  "I am glad I
bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another
bandbox!  Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and
talk and laugh all the way home.  And in the first place, let
us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away.
Have you seen any pleasant men?  Have you had any flirting?
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.  Jane will be quite an old maid soon,
I declare.  She is almost three and twenty!  Lord, how ashamed
I should be of not being married before three and twenty!  My
aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think.
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but <I>I</I> do
not think there would have been any fun in it.  Lord!  how I
should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls.  Dear me!  we had such a
good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Foster's.  Kitty and
me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to
have a little dance in the evening (by the bye, Mrs. Forster
and me are <I>such</I> friends!); and so she asked the two
Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced
to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?  We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass
for a lady, -- only think what fun!  Not a soul knew of it but
Col. and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we
were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine
how well he looked!  When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and
two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in
the least.  Lord!  how I laughed!  and so did Mrs. Forster.
I thought I should have died.  And <I>that</I> made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我们这样挤在一起，多够劲！”丽迪雅叫道<BR>
。“我买了顶帽子，真是高兴，就算特地添置<BR>
了一只帽盒，也很有趣！好吧，且让我们再偎<BR>
紧来舒服舒服，有说有笑地回到家里去。首先<BR>
，请你们讲一讲，你们离家以后遇到了些什么<BR>
事情。你们见到过一些中意的男人吗？跟人家<BR>
有过勾搭没有？我真希望你们哪一位带了个丈<BR>
夫回来呢。我说，吉英马上就要变成一个老处<BR>
女了。她快二十三岁啦！天哪！我要是不能在<BR>
二十三岁以前结婚，那多么丢脸啊！腓力普姨<BR>
妈要你们赶快找丈夫，你们可没有想到吧。她<BR>
说，丽萃要是嫁给柯林斯先生就好了，我可不<BR>
觉得那会有多大的趣味。天哪！我真巴不得比<BR>
你们哪一个都先结婚！我就可以领着你们上各<BR>
式各样的跳舞会去。我的老天爷！那天在弗斯<BR>
脱上校家里，我们那个玩笑真开得大啊！吉蒂<BR>
和我那天都准备在那儿玩个整天，弗斯脱太太<BR>
跟我是多么要好的朋友！）她于是请哈林顿家<BR>
的两位都来参加。可是海丽病了，因此萍不得<BR>
不独个赶来；这一来，你们猜我们怎么办？我<BR>
们把钱柏伦穿上了女人衣服，让人家当他是个<BR>
女人。你们且想想看，多有趣啊！除了上校、<BR>
弗斯脱太太、吉蒂和我、以及姨妈等人以外，<BR>
谁也不知道，说到姨妈，那是因为我们向她借<BR>
件长衣服，她才知道的。你们想象不到他扮得<BR>
多么象啊！丹尼、韦翰、普拉特和另外两三个<BR>
人走进来的时候，他们根本认不出是他。天哪<BR>
！我笑得好厉害，弗斯脱太太也笑得好厉害。<BR>
我简直要笑死了。这才叫那些男人们起了疑心<BR>
，他们不久就识穿了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did
Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to
amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.  Elizabeth
listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the
frequent mention of Wickham's name.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">丽迪雅就这样说说舞会上的故事，讲讲笑话，<BR>
另外还有吉蒂从旁给她添油加酱，使得大家一<BR>
路上很开心。伊丽莎白尽量不去听它，但是总<BR>
免不了听到一声声提起韦翰的名字。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Their reception at home was most kind.  Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to
see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during
dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">家里人极其亲切地接待她们。班纳特太太看到<BR>
吉英姿色未减，十分快活；吃饭的时候，班纳<BR>
特先生不由自主地一次又一次跟伊丽莎白说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你回来了，我真高兴，丽萃。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the
Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were
the subjects which occupied them.  Lady Lucas was enquiring of
Maria, across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her
eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand
collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who
sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to
the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder
than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures
of the morning to any body who would hear her.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他们饭厅里人很多，卢卡斯府上差不多全家人<BR>
都来接玛丽亚，顺便听听新闻，还问到各种各<BR>
样的问题。卢卡斯太太隔着桌子向玛丽亚问起<BR>
她大女儿日子过得好不好，鸡鸭养得多不多；<BR>
班纳特太太格外忙，因为吉英坐在她下手，她<BR>
便不断向她打听一些时下的风尚，然后再去传<BR>
给卢卡斯家几位年轻小姐去听；丽迪雅的嗓子<BR>
比谁都高，她正在把当天早上的乐趣一件件说<BR>
给爱听的人听。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had
such fun!  as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the
blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I
should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick;
and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very
handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would
have treated you too.  And then when we came away it was such
fun!  I thought we never should have got into the coach.  I was
ready to die of laughter.  And then we were so merry all the
way home!  we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might
have heard us ten miles off!"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢，曼丽，”她说，“你要是跟我们一块儿<BR>
去了多有趣！我们一路去的时候，吉蒂和我放<BR>
下车帘，看上去好象是空车，要是吉蒂没有晕<BR>
车，就会这样一直到目的地。我们在乔治客店<BR>
实在做得够漂亮，我们用世界上最美的冷盘款<BR>
待她们三位；假使你也去了，我们也会款待你<BR>
的。我们临走的时候，又是那么有趣！我以为<BR>
这样一挂车子无论如何也装不下我们。我真要<BR>
笑死啦。回家来一路上又是那么开心作乐！我<BR>
们有说有笑，声音大得十英里路外都能听见！<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear
sister, to depreciate such pleasures.  They would doubtless be
congenial with the generality of female minds.  But I confess
they would have no charms for me.  I should infinitely prefer a
book."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">曼丽听到这些话，便一本正经地回答道：“我<BR>
的好妹妹，并不是我故意要杀你们的风景，老<BR>
实说，你们这些乐趣当然会投合一般女子的爱<BR>
好可动不了我的心，我觉得读读书要有趣得多<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.  She seldom listened
to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to
Mary at all.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">可是丽迪雅把她这番话当做耳边风。谁说的话<BR>
她都不爱听，别说曼丽，她根本就不理她。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to
walk to Meryton, and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth
steadily opposed the scheme.  It should not be said, that the
Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were
in pursuit of the officers.  There was another reason too, for
her opposition.  She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was
resolved to avoid it as long as possible.  The comfort to <I>her</I>
of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression.  In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she
hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">到了下午，丽迪雅硬要姐姐们陪她上麦里屯去<BR>
，看看那边的朋友们近况如何，可是伊丽莎白<BR>
坚决反对，为的是不让别人说闲话，说班纳特<BR>
家的几位小姐在家里待不上半天，就要去追逐<BR>
军官们，她所以反对，还有一个理由。她怕再<BR>
看到韦翰。她已经下定决心，能够和他避而不<BR>
见就尽量避而不见。那个民兵团马上就要调走<BR>
了，她真是感觉到说不出的慰。不出四个星期<BR>
，他们就要走了，她希望他们一走以后，从此<BR>
平安无事，使她不会再为韦翰受到折磨。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the
Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the
inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest
intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so
vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她到家没有几个小时，就发觉父母在反复讨论<BR>
上白利屯去玩的计划，也就是丽迪雅在客店里<BR>
给她们提到过的那个计划。伊丽莎白看出她父<BR>
亲丝毫没有让步的意思，不过他的回答却是模<BR>
棱两可，因此她母亲虽然惯常碰钉子，可是这<BR>
一次并没有死心，还希望最后能如她的愿。<BR></TD>
