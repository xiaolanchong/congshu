	（一）第一分初[13]大本經第一
	
	
	如是我聞：
	
	Thus have I heard. 

一時，佛在[14]舍衛國[15]祇樹[16]花林窟，與大比丘眾千二百五十人俱。

At one time, the Buddha was staying in the country of Śrāvastī in the Kareri-kuṭikā quarter of Jetavana Monastery, accompanied by one thousand two hundred and fifty bhikṣus (disciples, monks).

時，諸比丘於乞食後集花林堂，各共議言：

At that time, after the morning almsround was completed, some bhikṣus gathered at the hall adjacent to the Kareri-kuṭikā, and each engaged in discussion with others, saying:

「諸賢比丘！唯無上尊為最奇特，神通遠達，威力弘大，乃知過去無數諸佛，入於涅槃，斷諸結使，[17]消滅戱論。

Venerable monks, the Unsurpassed Honorable One (anuttarā) is alone extraordinary. 
His supernormal power is far-reaching and has wide and great influence. Thus he [alone] knows those innumerable past buddhas who entered into nirvana, terminating all the defilements and extinguishing obsessive conceptualization. 

又知彼佛劫數多少，名號、姓字，所生種族，其所飲食，壽命脩短，所更苦樂。又知彼佛有如是戒，有如是法，有如是慧，有如是解，有如是住。

Again, he knows the numbers of eons ago when each of these respective buddhas appeared, their titles and names, the families into which they were born, the kinds of food of which they partook, whether their respective life spans were long or short, and in what social contexts they experienced the change between suffering and happiness. Again, he knows that each of those buddhas upheld a certain respective precept, taught a certain doctrine, realized a certain insight, acquired a certain understanding, and stayed in a certain state of realization. 

云何，諸賢！

How extraordinary is his knowledge, venerable colleagues! 

如來為善別法性，知如是事，為諸天來語，乃知此事？」

The Tathāgata distinctly knows the nature of things. Because he knows these things of the past, the heavenly gods (devas) come to talk to him.

爾時，世尊在閑靜處，天耳清淨，聞諸比丘作如是議，即從座起，詣花林堂，就座而坐。

At that time, the World-honored One was staying at a secluded place.  As his supernormal power of hearing was crystal clear, he happened to listen to the foregoing discussion that went on among the disciples. 
He arose from his seat at once, went to the Kareri-kuṭikā hall, and took his proper seat in the set position. 

爾時，世尊知而故問，謂：「諸比丘！汝等集此，何所語議？」

Then, knowingly, the World-honored One deliberately asked his disciples, “O bhikṣus, having gathered here, what have you been discussing?”

時，諸比丘具以事答。
The bhikṣus recounted the subject of their discussion in detail.

爾時，世尊告諸比丘：
Thereupon the World-honored One said to them:


「善哉！善哉！汝等以平等信，出家修道，諸所應行，凡有二業：一曰賢聖講法，二曰賢聖默然。汝等所論，正應如是。如來神通，威力弘大，盡知過去無數劫事，以能善解法性故知，亦以諸天來語故知。」佛時頌曰：


Very good, very good. You have renounced family life, each equally motivated by faith, and have been engaged in the practice of the path.
Of those prescribed practices, there are two kinds in general. First, the preaching of the wise and holy; and second, the silence of the wise and holy. O monks, the subject of your discussion must be formulated in the following manner: 
“The Tathāgata’s supernormal power has wide and great influence. Thus, he alone knows all events of the past through innumerable eons. 
As he thoroughly understands the nature of things, and because the heavenly gods come to talk to the Buddha, these things are known to him.”
The Buddha then continued in verse: 

The bhikṣus assembled in the lecture hall, 
Engaged in discussion on the nature of the wise and holy.
The Thus-come One remained in a secluded room, 
Knowing all through his supernormal hearing.
Like the rays of the sun, the Buddha illuminates the world, 
Discriminates the spheres of elements, and Knows all things of the past.
He knows of the final nirvana of those perfectly enlightened [ones],
Their titles, names, ancestry, and their birthplaces.
Following their lives wherever they were in place and time, 
The Buddha records everything
Through his witness by pure vision. 
Heavenly gods appeared with great authority and handsomeness,
Descended to inform me of the nirvana of those three groups of past buddhas,
Their titles and names, and the sound of mourning upon their [entrance into] nirvana.
The Unsurpassed Honorable One above heaven [and earth]
Thus has recorded [the destinies of] the past buddhas.
