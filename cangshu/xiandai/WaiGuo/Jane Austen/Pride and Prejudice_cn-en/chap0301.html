</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first
appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when
at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a
high flutter.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他们坐着车子一直向前去。彭伯里的树林一出<BR>
现在眼前，伊丽莎白就有些心慌；等到走进了<BR>
庄园，她更加；心神不定。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.
They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some
time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">花园很大，只见里边高阜低洼，气象万千。他<BR>
们拣一个最低的地方走进了园，在一座深邃辽<BR>
阔的美丽的树林里坐着车子走了好久。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw
and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.  They
gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves
at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased,
and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated
on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road, with
some abruptness, wound.  It was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge
of high woody hills; -- and in front, a stream of some natural
importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial
appearance.  Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely
adorned.  Elizabeth was delighted.  She had never seen a place
for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had
been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.  They were all
of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt
that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白满怀感触，无心说话，可是看到了每<BR>
一处、每一角的美景，她都叹赏不置。他们沿<BR>
着上坡路慢慢儿走了半英里光景，最后来到了<BR>
一个相当高的山坡上，这也就是树林子尽头的<BR>
地方，彭伯里大厦马上映入眼帘。房子在山谷<BR>
那边，有一条相当陡斜的路曲曲折折地通到谷<BR>
中。这是一幢很大很漂亮的石头建筑物，屹立<BR>
在高垅上，屋子后面枕着一连片树林茂密的高<BR>
高的小山冈；屋前一泓颇有天然情趣的溪流正<BR>
在涨潮，没有一丝一毫人工的痕迹。两岸的点<BR>
缀既不呆板，也不做作。伊丽莎白高兴极了。<BR>
她从来不曾看到过一个比这里更富于自然情趣<BR>
的地方，也没有见过任何地方的自然之美能象<BR>
这儿一样的不受到庸俗的沾损。大家都热烈地<BR>
赞赏不已，伊丽莎白顿时不禁觉得：在彭伯里<BR>
当个主妇也还不错吧。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the
door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all
her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.  She dreaded
lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.  On applying to see the
place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they
waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being
where she was.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他们下了山坡，过了桥，一直驶到大厦门前，<BR>
欣赏那附近一带的景物，伊丽莎白这时候不免<BR>
又起了一阵疑惧，生怕闯见主人。她担心旅馆<BR>
里的待女弄错了。他们请求进去参观，立刻被<BR>
让进客厅；大家都在等着管家奶奶，这时候伊<BR>
丽莎白方才想起身在何处。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman,
much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of
finding her.  They followed her into the dining-parlour.  It
was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to
enjoy its prospect.  The hill, crowned with wood, from which
they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object.  Every disposition of the
ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene -- the
river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the
valley, as far as she could trace it -- with delight.  As they
passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different
positions; but from every window there were beauties to be
seen.  The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture
suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw,
with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor
uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance,
than the furniture of Rosings.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">管家奶奶来了，是一个态度端庄的老妇人，远<BR>
不如她们想象中那么有丰姿，可是礼貌的周到<BR>
倒出乎她的想象。他们跟着她走进了餐室。那<BR>
是一间宽敞舒适的大屋子，布置得很精致。伊<BR>
丽莎白稍许看了一下，便走到窗口欣赏风景。<BR>
他们望着刚才下来的那座小山，只见丛林密布<BR>
，从远处望去益发显得陡峭，真是个美丽的地<BR>
方。处处都收拾得很美观。她纵目四望，只见<BR>
一弯河道，林木夹岸，山谷蜿蜒曲折，真看得<BR>
她心旷神怡。他们再走到别的房间里去看，每<BR>
换一个房间，景致总会两样，可是不管你走到<BR>
哪个窗口，都自有秀色可餐。一个个房间都高<BR>
大美观，家具陈设也和主人的身份颇为相称，<BR>
既不俗气，又不过分侈丽，比起罗新斯来，可<BR>
以说是豪华不足，风雅有余，伊丽莎白看了，<BR>
很佩服主人的情趣。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress!
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!
Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in
them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and
aunt. -- But no," -- recollecting herself, -- "that could never
be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not
have been allowed to invite them."  This was a lucky
recollection -- it saved her from something like regret.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她心里想：“我差一点就做了这儿的主妇呢！<BR>
这些房间也许早就让我走熟了！我非但不必以<BR>
一个陌生人的身份来参观，而且还可以当作自<BR>
己的住宅来受用，把舅父母当做贵客欢迎。可<BR>
是不行，”她忽然想了起来，“这是万万办不<BR>
到的事：那时候我就见不到舅父母了，他决不<BR>
会允许我邀他们来。”她幸亏想起了这一点，<BR>
才没有后悔当初的事。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master
were really absent, but had not courage for it.  At length,
however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned
away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was,
adding, "but we expect him tomorrow, with a large party of
friends."  How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey
had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她真想问问这位管家奶奶，主人是否真不在家<BR>
，可是她没有勇气，只得作罢。不过她舅父终<BR>
于代她问出了这一句话，使她大为慌张，连忙<BR>
别转头去，只听见雷诺奶奶回答道，他的确不<BR>
在家。接着又说，“可是明天会回家，还要带<BR>
来许多朋友。”伊丽莎白听了真高兴，幸亏他<BR>
们没有迟一天到这儿来。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.  She approached,
and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several
other miniatures, over the mantlepiece.  Her aunt asked her,
smilingly, how she liked it.  The housekeeper came forward, and
told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of
her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at
his own expence. -- "He is now gone into the army," she added,
"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她的舅母叫她去看一张画像。她走近前去，看<BR>
见那是韦翰的肖像，和另外几张小型画像夹在<BR>
一起，挂在壁炉架的上方，。舅母笑嘻嘻地问<BR>
她觉得好不好。管家奶奶走过来说，画像上这<BR>
位年轻人是老主人的帐房的儿子，由老主人一<BR>
手把他栽培起来折。她又说道：“他现在到军<BR>
队里去了，我怕他已经变得很浪荡了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth
could not return it.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳太太笑吟吟地对她外甥女儿望了一眼，<BR>
可是伊丽莎白实在笑不出来。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the
miniatures, "is my master -- and very like him.  It was drawn
at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">雷诺奶奶指着另一张画像说，“这就是我的小<BR>
主人，画得象极了。跟那一张是同时画的，大<BR>
约有八年了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said
Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.
But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳太太望着那张画像说：“我常常听人家<BR>
说，你的主人堂堂一表人材，他这张脸蛋的确<BR>
漂亮。──可是，丽萃，你倒说说看，画得象<BR>
不象。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on
this intimation of her knowing her master.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">雷诺奶奶听到伊丽莎白跟她主人相熟，便好象<BR>
益发敬重她。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这位小姐原来跟达西先生相熟？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth coloured, and said -- "A little."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白脸红了，只得说：“不太熟。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你觉得他是位很漂亮的少爷吗，小姐？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, very handsome."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“是的，很漂亮。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am sure <I>I</I> know none so handsome; but in the gallery
up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than
this.  This room was my late master's favourite room, and
these miniatures are just as they used to be then.  He was
very fond of them."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我敢说，我没见过这样漂亮的人；楼上画室<BR>
里还有一张他的画像，比这张大，画得也比这<BR>
张好。老主人生前最喜爱这间屋子，这些画像<BR>

些小型画像。”<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白这才明白为什么韦翰先生的像也放在<BR>
一起。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss
Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">雷诺奶奶接着又指给他们看达西小姐的一张画<BR>
像，那还是她八岁的时候画的。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said
Mr. Gardiner.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“达西小姐也跟她哥哥一样漂亮吗？”嘉丁纳<BR>
先生问道。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen;
and so accomplished! -- She plays and sings all day long.
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her --
a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢，那还用说──从来没有过这样漂亮的小<BR>
姐，又那么多才多艺！她成天弹琴唱歌。隔壁<BR>

我主人给她的礼物，她明天会跟他一块儿回来<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged
her communicativeness by his questions and remarks;
Mrs. Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently
great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">那位管家奶奶看见嘉丁纳先生为人那么随和，<BR>
便跟他有问有答。雷诺奶奶非常乐意谈到她主<BR>
人兄妹俩，这或者是由于为他们感到骄傲，或<BR>
者是由于和他们交情深厚。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你主人每年在彭伯里待的日子多吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may
spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for
the summer months."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“并没有我所盼望的那么多，先生，他每年大<BR>
概可以在这儿待上半年；达西小姐总是在这儿<BR>
歇夏。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白心想：“除非到拉姆斯盖特去就不来<BR>
了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“要是你主人结了婚，你见到他的时候就会多<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.  Elizabeth could not help saying,
"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should
think so."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳夫妇都笑了。伊丽莎白不由得说，“你<BR>
会这样想，真使他太有面子了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say
that knows him," replied the other.  Elizabeth thought this was
going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment
as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from
him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four
years old."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">管家奶奶说：“我说的全是真话，认识他的人<BR>
都是这样说，”伊丽莎白觉得这话实在讲得有<BR>
些过分。只听得那管家奶奶又说道：“我一辈<BR>
子没听过他一句重话，从他四岁起，我就跟他<BR>
在一起了。”伊丽莎白听得更是惊奇。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most
opposite to her ideas.  That he was not a good tempered man had
been her firmest opinion.  Her keenest attention was awakened;
she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for
saying,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这句褒奖的话说得最出人意料，也叫她最难想<BR>
象。她早就断定达西是个脾气不好的人，今日<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.
You are lucky in having such a master."
<BR></TD>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, Sir, I know I am.  If I was to go through the world,
I could not meet with a better.  But I have always observed
that they who are good-natured when children are good-natured
when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered,
most generous-hearted, boy in the world."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你真说得是，先生，我自己也知道运气好。<BR>
我就是走遍天下，再也不会碰到一个更好的主<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth almost stared at her. -- "Can this be Mr. Darcy!"
thought she.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白禁不住瞪起眼来看她。她心里想：“<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.

他独生子完全象他一样──也象他那样体贴穷<BR>
苦人。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for
more.  Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point.  She
related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the
rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.  Mr. Gardiner,
highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he
attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led
again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many
merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白一直听下去，先是奇怪，继而怀疑，<BR>
最后又极想再多听一些，可是雷诺奶奶再也想<BR>
不出别的话来引起她的兴趣。她谈到画像，谈<BR>
到房间大小，谈到家具的价格，可是她都不爱<BR>
听。嘉丁纳先生觉得，这个管家奶奶所以要过<BR>
甚其辞地夸奖她自己的主人，无非是出于家人<BR>
的偏见，这倒也使他听得很有趣，于是马上又<BR>
谈到这个话题上来了。她一面起劲地谈到他的<BR>
许多优点，一面领着他们走上大楼梯。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that
ever lived.  Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think
of nothing but themselves.  There is not one of his tenants or
servants but what will give him a good name.  Some people call
him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it.  To my
fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other
young men."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他是个开明的庄主，又是个最好的主人；”<BR>
她说，“他不象目前一般撒野的青年，一心只<BR>

有些人说他傲慢；可是我从来没看到过他有哪<BR>
一点傲慢的地方。据我猜想，他只是不象一般<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought
Elizabeth.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他被你说得多么可爱！”伊丽莎白想道。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked,

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她舅母一边走，一边轻轻地说：“只听到说他<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into
a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal
bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown.  In the former
were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the
art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had
willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in
crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also
more intelligible.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could
have little to fix the attention of a stranger.  Elizabeth
walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be
known to her.  At last it arrested her -- and she beheld a
striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the
face as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked
at her.  She stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they
quitted the gallery.  Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had
been taken in his father's life time.

gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in
the height of their acquaintance.  The commendation bestowed on
him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature.  What praise is
more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?  As a
brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's
happiness were in his guardianship! -- How much of pleasure or
pain it was in his power to bestow! -- How much of good or evil
must be done by him!  Every idea that had been brought forward
by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed
his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper
sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she
remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of
expression.

Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise on beholding his
master must immediately have told it.  They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and
confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew
not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her
family.  Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last
parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her
embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being
found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which
they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of
her life.  Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke,
his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated
his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and
of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way,
as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.

was overpowered by shame and vexation.  Her coming there was
the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!
How strange must it appear to him!  In what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man!  It might seem as if she had
purposely thrown herself in his way again!  Oh!  why did she
come?  or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?
Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been
beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that
he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse
or his carriage.  She blushed again and again over the
perverseness of the meeting.  And his behaviour, so strikingly
altered, -- what could it mean?  That he should even speak to
her was amazing! -- but to speak with such civility, to enquire
after her family!  Never in her life had she seen his manners
so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness
as on this unexpected meeting.  What a contrast did it offer to
his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into
her hand!  She knew not what to think, nor how to account for
it.

and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or
a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but
it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it;
and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals
of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such
objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the
scene.  Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of
Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was.  She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his
mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in
defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him.  Perhaps he
had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there
had been <I>that</I> in his voice which was not like ease.  Whether
he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she
could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a
while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots
where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander,
were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills,
with the long range of woods overspreading many, and
occasionally part of the stream.  Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a
walk.  With a triumphant smile, they were told that it was ten
miles round.  It settled the matter; and they pursued the
accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time,
in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in
one of its narrowest parts.  They crossed it by a simple
bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was
a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the
valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which
bordered it.  Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but
when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance
from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker,
could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the
carriage as quickly as possible.  Her niece was, therefore,
obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on
the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but
their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able
to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much
engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in
the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced
but little.  Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were
again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal
to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance.  The walk being
here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see
him before they met.  Elizabeth, however astonished, was at
least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved
to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to
meet them.  For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would
probably strike into some other path.  This idea lasted while a
turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning
past, he was immediately before them.  With a glance she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate
his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of
the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful,"
and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and
she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be
mischievously construed.  Her colour changed, and she said no
more.

alteration.  It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by
the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate
to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.
Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together.  After a short silence, the lady first spoke.  She
wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence
before she came to the place, and accordingly began by
observing that his arrival had been very unexpected -- "for
your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would
certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell we understood that you were not immediately
expected in the country."  He acknowledged the truth of it all;

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was
too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have
of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother,
and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was
gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think
really ill of her.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这个要求真使她受宠若惊；她不知道应该答应<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.
Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was
flattered and pleased.  His wish of introducing his sister to
her was a compliment of the highest kind.  They soon
outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage,
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.

herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.  At
such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very
awkward.  She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on
every subject.  At last she recollected that she had been
travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove-Dale with great
perseverance.  Yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the
tete-a-tete was over.  On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming
up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some
refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each
side with the utmost politeness.  Mr. Darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner,
"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in
so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.  He
has not an ill-natured look.  On the contrary, there is
something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.  And there
is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give
one an unfavourable idea of his heart.  But to be sure, the
good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming
character!  I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.  But
he is a liberal master, I suppose, and <I>that</I> in the eye of a
servant comprehends every virtue."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳太太接着说：“从我们看到他的一些情<BR>
形来说，我真想象不出，他竟会那样狠心地对<BR>
待可怜的韦翰。这人看上去心地不坏。他说起<BR>
话来，嘴上的表情倒很讨人喜欢。至于他脸上<BR>
的表情，的确有些尊严，不过人家也不会因此<BR>
就说他心肠不好。只胡带我们去参观的那个管<BR>
家奶奶，倒真把他的性格说得天花乱坠。有几<BR>

来，一切的德性就在于这一点上面。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in
vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave
them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that
by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions
were capable of a very different construction; and that his
character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable,
as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.  In confirmation
of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually
naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be
relied on.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白听到这里，觉得应该替达西说几句公<BR>

在肯特郡的有些亲友，他们曾告诉她，他的行<BR>
为和人家所传说的情形大有出入，他的为人决<BR>
不象哈福德郡的人们所想象的那么荒谬，韦翰<BR>
的为为也决不象哈福德郡的人们所想象的那么<BR>
厚道。为了证实这一点，她又把他们两人之间<BR>
银钱往来上的事情，一五一十地讲了出来，虽<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave
way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged
in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its
environs to think of any thing else.  Fatigued as she had been
by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set
off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening
was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after
many years discontinuance.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这番话使嘉丁纳太太听得既感惊奇，又极担心<BR>
