<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,
as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to
bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed
after Lady Catherine's visit.  The gentlemen arrived early;
and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having
seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread,
Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all
walking out.  It was agreed to.  Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the
remaining five set off together.  Bingley and Jane, however,
soon allowed the others to outstrip them.  They lagged behind,
while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.
Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of
him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate
resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.

anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and
immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand
that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since
the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with
gratitude and pleasure his present assurances.  The happiness
which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as
sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be
supposed to do.  Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his
eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt
delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she
could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings,
which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白听他这样表明心迹，越发为他感到不<BR>

现在，她的心情已经起了很大的变化，现在她<BR>
愿意心愉快和感激的心情来接受他这一番盛情<BR>
美意。这个回答简直使他感到从来没有过的快<BR>
乐，他正象一个狂恋热爱的人一样，立刻抓住<BR>
这个机会，无限乖巧、无限热烈地向她倾诉衷<BR>
曲。要是伊丽莎白能够抬起头来看看他那双眼<BR>
睛，她就可以看出，他那满脸喜气洋洋的神气<BR>
，使他变得多么漂亮；她虽然不敢看他的脸色<BR>
，却敢听他的声音；只听得他把千丝万缕的感<BR>
情都告诉了她，说她在他心目中是多么重要，<BR>
使她越听越觉得他情感的宝贵。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">They walked on, without knowing in what direction.  There was
too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to
any other objects.  She soon learnt that they were indebted
for their present good understanding to the efforts of his
aunt, who <I>did</I> call on him in her return through London,
and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and
the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling
emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her
ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness
and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist
her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which
<I>she</I> had refused to give.  But, unluckily for her ladyship,
its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

归功于他姨母的一番力量，原来他姨母回去的<BR>

到浪搏恩来的经过、动机，以及和伊丽莎白谈<BR>

shall never forget: ``had you behaved in a more gentleman-like

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end
so.  The adieu is charity itself.  But think no more of the
letter.  The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person
who received it, are now so widely different from what they

ought to be forgotten.  You must learn some of my philosophy.
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."

<I>Your</I> retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that
the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but,

so.  Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which
ought not, to be repelled.  I have been a selfish being all my
life, in practice, though not in principle.  As a child I was
taught what was <I>right</I>, but I was not taught to correct my
temper.  I was given good principles, but left to follow them
in pride and conceit.  Unfortunately an only son (for many
years an only <I>child</I>), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though
good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was
benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me
to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own
family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to
<I>wish</I> at least to think meanly of their sense and worth
compared with my own.  Such I was, from eight to eight and
twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest,
loveliest Elizabeth!  What do I not owe you!  You taught me a
lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.  By you,

surprise was great.  He had never had the slightest suspicion.
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in
supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to
him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her
was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."

unjustly, offended him.  I could not allow myself to conceal
that your sister had been in town three months last winter,
that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.  He was
angry.  But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than
he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.  He has

to begin.  In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of
course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house.  In the hall they
parted.
