Upper-Intermediate - Getting Old Isn't Easy

(D1149)

A

老赵，很久没看你出来遛鸟了？

Lǎo Zhào, hěn jiǔ méi kàn nǐ chūlai liùniǎo le?

Seems like I haven't seen you take your bird for a walk in a long time, Lao Zhao.

B

哪有心情遛啊？家里闹得鸡飞狗跳的，把我给烦死了。

nǎyǒu xīnqíng liù a? jiālǐ nào de jīfēigǒutiào de, bǎ wǒ gěi fán sǐ le.

How could I been in the mood to walk my bird? They're fighting and carrying on at home. It's driving me crazy!

A

怎么啦？

zěnme la?

What's wrong?

B

我还没咽气呢，几个孩子就开始争房子了。

wǒ hái méi yànqì ne, jǐ ge háizi jiù kāishǐ zhēng fángzi le.

I haven't even croaked, and my kids are already fighting over the house.

A

哎，我们做父母的，操劳一辈子，最怕看到这种结果了。不过你看开点儿，现在好多家庭都是这样。

ài, wǒmen zuò fùmǔ de, cāoláo yībèizi, zuì pà kàndào zhèzhǒng jiéguǒ le. bùguò nǐ kàn kāi diǎnr, xiànzài hǎo duō jiātíng dōu shì zhèyàng.

Agh-- parents like us work hard all our lives. More than anything, we hate to see things come to this. But get used to it-- a lot of households are like this these days.

B

我真没想到，家里四个孩子为了一点财产，撕破脸皮，手足之情都不要了。 那天他们在家里吵，气得我差点儿心脏病发作！

wǒ zhēn méixiǎngdào, jiālǐ sì ge háizi wèile yīdiǎn cáichǎn, sīpò liǎnpí, shǒuzú zhī qíng dōu bù yào le.  nà tiān  tāmen zài jiāli chǎo, qì de wǒ chàdiǎnr xīnzàngbìng fāzuò!

I really had no idea. All four kids are willing to destroy their relationship just for a little bit of property. Once, I got so angry when they were fighting that I almost had a heart attack!

A

你可得当心身体，现在生不起病。

nǐ kě děi  dāngxīn  shēntǐ, xiànzài shēngbuqǐ bìng.

You really need to take care of yourself. You really can't afford to get sick now!

B

还是你好啊，生了个孝顺女儿。

háishì nǐ hǎo a, shēng le ge xiàoshùn nǚ ér.

You're better off. You have a daughter who treats her parents right.

A

也不好啊。我闺女到现在还是单身呢。我们介绍的她看不上，自己找的又都没谈出结果。

yě bù hǎo a. wǒ guīnv dào xiànzài hái shì dānshēn ne. wǒmen jièshào de tā kànbushàng, zìjǐ zhǎo de yòu dōu méi tán chū jiéguǒ.

Actually, I'm no better. My little girl is still single. She doesn't like the people we introduce her to. And nothing has ever come of the ones she finds on her own.

B

哎，我们干着急也没用。再说有闺女在身边照顾你，多好啊。

ài, wǒmen gān zháojí yě méiyòng. zài shuō yǒu guīnv zài shēnbiān zhàogu nǐ, duō hǎo a.

Ah, it doesn't do any good for us to be in a hurry. And anyway, you've got your daughter at your side to take care of you. That's great.

A

哎，你说得对，我们老的干着急也没用。

ài, nǐ shuō de duì, wǒmen lǎo de gān zháojí yě méiyòng.

Agh, you're right. It doesn't do any good for us old guys to get antsy.

C

老赵、老陆，你们在这儿啊！

Lǎo Zhào, Lǎo Lù, nǐmen zài zhèr a!

Lao Zhao, Lao Lu-- here you are!

A

哟，老陈，听说你到台湾去玩儿了。

yō, Lǎo Chén, tīngshuō nǐ dào Táiwān qù wánr le.

Hey, Lao Chen. I hear you went on a trip to Taiwan.

C

对，带老伴儿走了一圈。真不错！你们有机会，也要出去走走。

duì, dài lǎobànr zǒu le yī quān. zhēn bùcuò! nǐmen yǒu jīhuì, yě yào chūqù zǒu zou.

Yeah. I took my wife all around. It was great! If you guys get a chance, you should go, too.

B

哪有你这么有福气啊？

nǎyǒu nǐ zhème yǒu fúqì a?

How could we get as lucky as you?

C

我们老年人福气要自己找。我要去公园唱戏了。下次请你们来我家，看我在台湾拍的照片。我先走了！

wǒmen lǎoniánrén fúqì yào zìjǐ zhǎo. wǒ yào qù gōngyuán chàngxì  le. xiàcì qǐng nǐmen lái wǒ jiā, kàn wǒ zài Táiwān pāi de zhàopiàn. wǒ xiān zǒu le!

Old folks like us have to look for our own happiness. I'm going to the park to sing opera. Soon I'll have you over to my house to look at the pictures I took in Taiwan. So long!

A

老陈活得真潇洒。

Lǎo Chén huó de zhēn xiāosǎ.

Lao Chen really lives the good life.
