<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.  The
very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all
settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her
brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to
his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the
rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed
affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.  Miss
Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.  Her many attractions
were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their
increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment
of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some
plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.  Elizabeth,
to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.  Her heart was divided between
concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss
Darcy she paid no credit.  That he was really fond of Jane, she
doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had
always been disposed to like him, she could not think without
anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper,
that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of
his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own
happiness to the caprice of their inclinations.  Had his own
happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been
allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best;
but her sister's was involved in it, as, she thought, he must
be sensible himself.  It was a subject, in short, on which
reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.  She
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard
had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends'
interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment,
or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the
case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by
the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her
peace equally wounded.

replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you
are supposing.  They have known her much longer than they have
known me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever
may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have
opposed their brother's.  What sister would think herself at
liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable?  If they believed him attached to me, they would
not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.
By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting
unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.  Do not distress
me by the idea.  I am not ashamed of having been mistaken --
or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what
I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.  Let me
take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be
understood."

returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which
Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little
chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.  Her
daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not
believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when
he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement
was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat
every day.  Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley
must be down again in the summer.

said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find.
I congratulate her.  Next to being married, a girl likes to
be crossed in love a little now and then.  It is something
to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her
companions.  When is your turn to come?  You will hardly
bear to be long outdone by Jane.  Now is your time.  Here are

gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many
of the Longbourn family.  They saw him often, and to his other
recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.  The
whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on
Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now
openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy
before they had known any thing of the matter.
