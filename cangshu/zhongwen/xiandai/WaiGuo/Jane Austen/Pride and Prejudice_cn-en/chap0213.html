<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not
expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no
expectation at all of its contents.  But such as they were, it
may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and
what a contrariety of emotion they excited.  Her feelings as
she read were scarcely to be defined.  With amazement did she
first understand that he believed any apology to be in his
power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no
explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not
conceal.  With a strong prejudice against every thing he might
say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.
She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of
comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next
sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense
of the one before her eyes.  His belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his
account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made
her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.  He
expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her;
his style was not penitent, but haughty.  It was all pride and
insolence.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.
Wickham, when she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a
relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every
cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an
affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet
more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.
She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming,
"This must be false!  This cannot be!  This must be the
grossest falsehood!" -- and when she had gone through the whole
letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or
two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard
it, that she would never look in it again.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest
on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a
minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as
well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of
all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to
examine the meaning of every sentence.  The account of his
connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had
related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though
she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with
his own words.  So far each recital confirmed the other; but
when she came to the will, the difference was great.  What
Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as
she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that
there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a
few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all
pretensions to the living, of his receiving, in lieu, so
considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she
forced to hesitate.  She put down the letter, weighed every
circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality --
deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with
little success.  On both sides it was only assertion.  Again
she read on.  But every line proved more clearly that the
affair, which she had believed it impossible that any
contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct
in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make
him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她就这样心烦意乱地往前走，真是千头万绪，<BR>
不知从哪里想起才好。可是不到半分钟工夫，<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not
to lay to Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the
more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.  She had
never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire
Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young
man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there
renewed a slight acquaintance.  Of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told
himself.  As to his real character, had information been in her
power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.  His
countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in
the possession of every virtue.  She tried to recollect some
instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or
benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for
those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class
what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many
years continuance.  But no such recollection befriended her.
She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air
and address; but she could remember no more substantial good
than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the
regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.
After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more
continued to read.  But, alas!  the story which followed, of
his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what
had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the
morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of
every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself -- from whom
she had previously received the information of his near concern
in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question.  At one time she had almost resolved on
applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of
the application, and at length wholly banished by the
conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a
proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin's
corroboration.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西竟毫不迟疑地把骄奢淫佚的罪名加在韦翰<BR>
先生身上，这使她极其惊骇──何况她又提不<BR>
出反证，于是就越发惊骇。在韦翰先生参加某<BR>
某郡的民兵团之前，伊丽莎白根本没有听到过<BR>
他这个人。至于他所以要参加民兵团，也只是<BR>
因为偶然在镇上遇见了以前一个泛泛之交的朋<BR>
友，劝他加入的。讲到他以前的为人处世，除<BR>
了他自己所说的以外，她完全一无所知。至于<BR>
他的真正的人品，她即使可以打听得到，也并<BR>
没有想要去追根究底。他的仪态音容，叫人一<BR>
眼看去就觉得他身上具备了一切美德。她竭力<BR>
要想起一两件足以说明他品行优良的事实，想<BR>
起他一些为人诚实仁爱的特性，使达西先生所<BR>
指责的诽谤可以不攻自破，至少也可以使他的<BR>
优点遮盖得住他偶然的过失。她所谓他的偶然<BR>
过失，都是针对达西先生所指责的连年来的懒<BR>
惰和恶习而说的，可惜她就想不出他这样的一<BR>
些好处来。她眨下眼睛就可以看到他出现在她<BR>
面前，风采翩翩，辞令优雅，但是，除了邻里<BR>
的赞赏之外，除了他用交际手腕在伙伴之间赢<BR>
得的敬慕之外，她可想不起他有什么更具体的<BR>
优点。她思考了好一会儿以后，又继续读信。<BR>
可是天哪！接下去就读到他对达西小姐的企图<BR>
，这只要想一想昨天上午她跟费茨威廉上校的<BR>
谈话，不就是可以证实了吗？信上最后要她把<BR>
每一个细节都问问费茨威廉上校本人，问问他<BR>
是否真有其事。以前她就曾经听费茨威廉上校<BR>
亲自说起过，他对他表兄达西的一切事情都极<BR>
其熟悉，同时她也没有理由去怀疑费茨威廉的<BR>
人格。她一度几乎下定了决心要去问他，但是<BR>
问起这件事不免又要有多少别扭，想到这里，<BR>
她便把这个主意暂时搁了下来。后来她又想到<BR>
，如果达西拿不准他表弟的话会和他自己完全<BR>
一致，那他决不会冒冒失失提出这样一个建议<BR>
，于是她就干脆打消了这个主意。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in
conversation between Wickham and herself in their first evening
at Mr. Philips's.  Many of his expressions were still fresh in
her memory.  She was now struck with the impropriety of such
communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her
before.  She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as
he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his
conduct.  She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy -- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country,
but that <I>he</I> should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the
Netherfield ball the very next week.  She remembered also, that
till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had
told his story to no one but herself; but that after their
removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no
reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though
he had assured her that respect for the father would always
prevent his exposing the son.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">How differently did every thing now appear in which he was
concerned!  His attentions to Miss King were now the
consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the
mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of
his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.  His
behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he
had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had
been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which
she believed she had most incautiously shown.  Every lingering
struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther
justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that
Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his
blamelessness in the affair; that, proud and repulsive as were
his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance -- an acquaintance which had latterly brought them
much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways
-- seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or
unjust -- any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral
habits.  That among his own connections he was esteemed and
valued -- that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother,
and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of <I>some</I> amiable feeling.  That
had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a
violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed
from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of
it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was
incomprehensible.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">凡是有关他的事情，怎么这样前后悬殊！他向<BR>

彬格莱先生问起这事时，彬格莱先生说，达西<BR>

他们认识以来（特别是最近他们时常见面，她<BR>

认他不愧为一个好哥哥，她还常常听到达西爱<BR>

circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having
passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on
his mind than on hers.  The compliment to herself and her
