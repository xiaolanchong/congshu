A

朱丽叶，好啊，你敢炒我鱿鱼！

Zhūlìyè, hǎoā, nǐ gǎn chǎo wǒ yóuyú!

OK, Zhu Liye. You dare to fire ME!

B

老王，你别激动。不是我要炒你，是公司的决定。我也没办法。

Lǎo Wáng , nǐ bié jīdòng. bù shì wǒ yào chǎo nǐ, shì gōngsī de juédìng. wǒ yě méi bànfǎ.

Don't get excited, Lao Wang. It's not me that's firing you. It's the company's decision. There's nothing I can do, either.

A

我知道，肯定是那个周俊！我找他去。

wǒ zhīdào, kěndìng shì nàge Zhōu Jùn! wǒ zhǎo tā qù.

I know. It's got to be that Zhou Jun! I'll go find him...

A

周俊，你一直看我不顺眼，现在终于把我炒了！

Zhōu Jùn, nǐ yīzhí kàn wǒ bù shùnyǎn, xiànzài zhōngyú bǎ wǒ chǎo le!

Zhou Jun, you've always had something against me. Now you've finally fired me!

C

老王，在公司不要这样，有话好好说。

Lǎo Wáng, zài gōngsī bù yào zhèyàng, yǒu huà hǎohāo shuō.

Lao Wang, you shouldn't be this way in the office. If you have something to say, say it.

A

我怎么了？你凭什么炒我？

wǒ zěnmele? nǐ píng shénme chǎo wǒ?

What's wrong with me? Where do you get off firing me?

C

是，你是老员工，但是今年你的绩效评估很差。

shì, nǐ shì lǎo yuángōng, dànshì jīnnián nǐ de jìxiào pínggū hěn chà.

It's true, you're an old employee. But this year, your performance evaluation was really lousy.

A

好，那我也告诉你，想炒我，没那么容易！现在有劳动法，我要去告你们！

hǎo, nà wǒ yě gàosu nǐ, xiǎng chǎo wǒ, méi nàme róngyì! xiànzài yǒu láodòngfǎ, wǒ yào qù gào nǐmen!

OK, then I'll tell you right now: If you want to fire me, it won't be so easy! Now there's a Labor Law. I'm gonna sue you guys!
