<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her
sister, and, seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her
into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two
friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had
never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which
passed before the gentlemen appeared.  Their powers of
conversation were considerable.  They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour,
and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">娘儿们吃过晚饭以后，伊丽莎白就上楼到她姐<BR>
姐那儿去，看她穿戴得妥妥贴贴，不会着凉，<BR>
便陪着她上客厅去。她的女朋友们见到她，都<BR>
表示欢迎，一个个都说非常高兴。在男客们没<BR>
有来的那一个钟头里，她们是那么和蔼可亲，<BR>
伊丽莎白从来不曾看到过。她们的健谈本领真<BR>
是吓人，描述起宴会来纤毫入微，说起故事来<BR>
风趣横溢，讥笑起一个朋友来也是有有声有色<BR>
。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first
object.  Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards
Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had
advanced many steps.  He addressed himself directly to Miss
Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a
slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and
warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.  He was full of joy
and attention.  The first half hour was spent in piling up the
fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she
removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that
she might be farther from the door.  He then sat down by her,
and talked scarcely to any one else.  Elizabeth, at work in the
opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">可是男客们一走进来，吉英就不怎么引人注目<BR>
了。达西一进门，彬格莱小姐的眼睛就立刻转<BR>
到他身上去，要跟他说话。达西首先向班纳特<BR>
小姐问好，客客气气地祝贺她病休复元；赫斯<BR>
脱先生也对她微微一鞠躬，说是见到她“非常<BR>
高兴”；但是说到词气周到，情意恳切，可就<BR>
比不上彬格莱先生那几声问候。彬格莱先生才<BR>
算得上情深意切，满怀欢欣。开头半小时完全<BR>
消磨在添煤上面，生怕屋子里冷起来会叫病人<BR>
受不了。吉英依照彬格莱的话，移坐到火炉的<BR>
另一边去，那样她就离开门口远一些，免得受<BR>
凉。接着他自己在她身旁坐下，一心跟她说话<BR>
，简直不理睬别人。伊丽莎白正在对面角落里<BR>
做活计，把这全部情景都看在眼里，感到无限<BR>
高兴。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table -- but in vain.  She had obtained private
intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and
Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.  She
assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of
the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her.
Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on
one of the sofas and go to sleep.  Darcy took up a book; Miss
Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in
playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in
her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">喝过茶以后，赫斯脱先生提醒她的小姨子把牌<BR>
桌摆好，可是没有用。她早就看出达西先生不<BR>
想打牌，因此赫斯脱先生后来公开提出要打牌<BR>
也被她拒绝了。她跟他说，谁也不想玩牌，只<BR>
见全场对这件事都不作声，看来她的确没有说<BR>
错。因此，赫斯脱先生无事可做，只得，，躺<BR>
在沙发上打瞌睡。达西拿起一本书来。彬格莱<BR>
小姐也拿起一本书来。赫斯脱太太聚精会神地<BR>
在玩弄自己的手镯和指环，偶而也在她弟弟跟<BR>
班纳特小姐的对话中插几句嘴。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching
Mr. Darcy's progress through <I>his</I> book, as in reading her own;
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking
at his page.  She could not win him, however, to any
conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her
own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second
volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way!  I declare after all there
is no enjoyment like reading!  How much sooner one tires of any
thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall
be miserable if I have not an excellent library."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱小姐一面看达西读书，一面自己读书，<BR>
两件事同时并做，都是半心半意。她老是向他<BR>
问句什么的，或者是看他读到哪一页。不过，<BR>
她总是没有办法逗她说话；她问一句他就答一<BR>
句，答过以后便继续读他的书。彬格莱小姐所<BR>
以要挑选那一本书读，只不过因为那是达西所<BR>
读的第二卷，她满想读个津津有味，不料这会<BR>
儿倒读得精疲力尽了。她打了个呵欠，说道：<BR>
“这样度过一个晚上，真是多么愉快啊！我说<BR>
呀，什么娱乐也抵不上读书的乐趣。无论干什<BR>
么事，都是一上手就要厌倦，读书却不会这样<BR>
！将来有一天我自己有了家，要是没有个很好<BR>
的书房，那会多遗憾哟。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">No one made any reply.  She then yawned again, threw aside
her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some
amusement; when, hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss
Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">谁也没有理睬她。于是她又打了个呵欠，抛开<BR>
书本，把整个房间里望了一转，要想找点儿什<BR>
么东西消遗消遗，这时忽听得她哥哥跟班纳特<BR>
小姐说要开一次跳舞会，她就猛可地掉过头来<BR>
对他说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a
dance at Netherfield? -- I would advise you, before you
determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party;
I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a
ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这样说，查尔斯，你真打算在尼日斐花园开<BR>
一次跳舞会吗？我劝你最好还是先征求一下在<BR>
场朋友们的意见再作决定吧。这里面就会有人<BR>
觉得跳舞是受罪，而不是娱乐，要是没有这种<BR>
人，你怪我好了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if
he chooses, before it begins -- but as for the ball, it is quite
a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup
enough I shall send round my cards."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“如果你指的是达西，”她的哥哥大声说，“<BR>
那么，他可以在跳舞开始以前就上床去睡觉，<BR>
随他的便好啦。舞会已经决定了非开不可，只<BR>
等尼可尔斯把一切都准备好了，我就下请贴。<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they
were carried on in a different manner; but there is something
insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead
of dancing made the order of the day."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱小姐说：“要是开舞会能换些花样，那<BR>
我就更高兴了，通常舞会上的那老一套，实在<BR>
讨厌透顶。你如果能把那一天的日程改一改，<BR>
用谈话来代替跳舞，那一定有意思得多。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would
not be near so much like a ball."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“也许有意思得多，珈罗琳，可是那还象什么<BR>
舞会呢。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and
walked about the room.  Her figure was elegant, and she walked
well; -- but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still
inflexibly studious.  In the desperation of her feelings she
resolved on one effort more; and turning to Elizabeth, said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱小姐没有回答。不大一会儿工夫，她就<BR>
站起身来，在房间里踱来踱去，故意在达西面<BR>
前卖弄她优美的体态和矫健的步伐，只可惜达<BR>
西只顾在那里一心一意地看书，因此她只落得<BR>
枉费心机。她绝望之余，决定再作一次努力，<BR>
于是转过身来对伊丽莎白说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example,
and take a turn about the room. -- I assure you it is very
refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“伊丽莎・班纳特小姐，我劝你还是学学我的<BR>
样子，在房间里霞走动走动吧。告诉你，坐了<BR>
那么久，走动一下可以提提精神。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.  Miss
Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility;
Mr. Darcy looked up.  He was as much awake to the novelty of
attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and
unconsciously closed his book.  He was directly invited to join
their party, but he declined it, observing that he could
imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining
them would interfere.  "What could he mean?  she was dying to
know what could be his meaning" -- and asked Elizabeth whether
she could at all understand him?
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白觉得很诧异，可是立刻依了她的意思<BR>
。于是彬格莱小姐献殷勤的真正目的达到了─<BR>
─达西先生果然抬起头来，原来达西也和伊丽<BR>
莎白一样，看出了她在耍花招引人注目，便不<BR>
知不觉地放下了书本。两位小姐立刻请他来一<BR>
块儿踱步，可是他谢绝了，说是她们俩所以要<BR>
在屋子里踱来踱去，据他的想象，无非有两个<BR>
动机，如果他参加她们一起散步，对于她们的<BR>
任何一个动机都会有妨碍。他这话是什么意思<BR>
？彬格莱小姐极想街道他讲这话用意何在，便<BR>
问伊丽莎白懂不懂。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to
be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will
be to ask nothing about it."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白回答道：“根本不懂，他一定是存心<BR>
刁难我们，不过你最好不要理睬他，让他失望<BR>
一下。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy
in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an
explanation of his two motives.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">可惜彬格莱小姐遇到任何事情都不忍心叫达西<BR>
先生失望，于是再三要求他非把他的所谓两个<BR>
动机解释一下不可。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said
he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.  "You either choose
this method of passing the evening because you are in each
other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or
because you are conscious that your figures appear to the
greatest advantage in walking; -- if the first, I should be
completely in your way; -- and if the second, I can admire you
much better as I sit by the fire."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">达西等她一住口，便马上说：“我非常愿意解<BR>
释一下，事情不外乎是这样的，你们是心腹之<BR>
交，所以选择了这个办法来消磨黄昏，还要谈<BR>
谈私事，否则就是你们自以为散起步来体态显<BR>
得特别好看，所以要散散步。倘若是出于第一<BR>
个动机，我夹在你们一起就会妨碍你们；假若<BR>
是出于第二个动机，那么我坐在火炉旁边可以<BR>
更好地欣赏你们。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  shocking!" cried Miss Bingley.  "I never heard any thing
so abominable.  How shall we punish him for such a speech?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“噢，吓坏人！”彬格莱小姐叫起来了。“我<BR>
从来没听到过这么毒辣的话。──亏他说得出<BR>
，该怎么罚他呀？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said
Elizabeth.  "We can all plague and punish one another.  Tease
him -- laugh at him. -- Intimate as you are, you must know how
it is to be done."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“要是你存心罚他，那是再容易不过的事，”<BR>
伊丽莎白说。“彼此都可以罚来罚去，折磨来<BR>
折磨去。作弄他一番吧──讥笑他一番吧。你<BR>
们既然这么相熟，你该懂得怎么对付他呀。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"But upon my honour I do <I>not</I>.  I do assure you that my
intimacy has not yet taught me <I>that</I>.  Tease calmness of
temper and presence of mind!  No, no -- I feel he may defy us
there.  And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if
you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.
Mr. Darcy may hug himself."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“天地良心，我不懂得。不瞒你说，我们虽然<BR>
相熟，可是要懂得怎样来对付他，不差得远呢<BR>
。想要对付这种性格冷静和头脑机灵的人，可<BR>
不容易！不行，不行，我想我们是搞不过他的<BR>
。至于讥笑他，说句你不生气的话，我们可不<BR>
能凭空笑人家，弄得反而惹人笑话。让达西先<BR>
生去自鸣得意吧。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth.  "That is
an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue,
for it would be a great loss to <I>me</I> to have many such
acquaintance.  I dearly love a laugh."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“原来达西先生是不能让人笑话的！”伊丽莎<BR>
白嚷道。“这种优越的条件倒真少有，我希望<BR>
一直不要多，这样的朋友多了，我的损失可大<BR>
啦。我特别喜欢笑话。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than
can be.  The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and
best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person
whose first object in life is a joke."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“彬格莱小姐过奖我啦。”他说。“要是一个<BR>
人把开玩笑当作人生最重要的事，那么，最聪<BR>
明最优秀的人───不，最聪明最优秀的行为<BR>
───也就会变得可笑了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Certainly," replied Elizabeth -- "there are such people, but I
hope I am not one of <I>them</I>.  I hope I never ridicule what is
wise or good.  Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies
<I>do</I> divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. --
But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那当然罗，”伊丽莎白回答道，“这样的人<BR>
的确有，可是我希望我自己不在其内。我希望<BR>
我怎么样也不会讥笑聪明的行为或者是良好的<BR>
行为。愚蠢和无聊，荒唐和矛盾，这的确叫我<BR>
觉得好笑，我自己也承认，我只要能够加以讥<BR>
笑，总是加以讥笑。不过我觉得这些弱点正是<BR>
你向上所没有的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Perhaps that is not possible for any one.  But it has been the
study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a
strong understanding to ridicule."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“或许谁都还会有这些弱点，否则可真糟了，<BR>
绝顶的聪慧也要招人嘲笑了。我一生都在研究<BR>
该怎么样避免这些弱点。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Such as vanity and pride."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“例如虚荣和傲慢就是属于这一类弱点。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.  But pride -- where there is
a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good
regulation."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不错，虚荣的确是个弱点。可是傲慢──只<BR>
要你果真聪明过人──你就会傲慢得比较有分<BR>
寸。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白掉过头去，免得人家看见她发笑。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley; -- "and pray what is the result?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你考问达西先生考问好了吧，我想，”彬格<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.
He owns it himself without disguise."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我完全承认达西先生没有一些缺点。他自己<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"No" -- said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension.  I have
faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.
My temper I dare not vouch for. -- It is I believe too little
yielding -- certainly too little for the convenience of the
world.  I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon
as I ought, nor their offences against myself.  My feelings are
not puffed about with every attempt to move them.  My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. -- My good opinion once lost
is lost for ever."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不，”达西说，“我并没有说过这种装场面<BR>
的话。我有够多的毛病，不过这些毛病与头脑<BR>
并没有关系。至于我的性格，我可不敢自夸。<BR>
我认为我的性格太不能委曲求全，这当然是说<BR>
我在处世方面太不能委曲求全地随和别人。别<BR>
人的愚蠢和过错我本应该赶快忘掉，却偏偏忘<BR>
不掉；人家得罪了我，我也忘不掉。说到我的<BR>
一些情绪，也并不是我一打算把它们去除掉，<BR>
它们就会烟消云散。我的脾气可以说是够叫人<BR>
厌恶的。我对于某个人一旦没有了好感，就永<BR>
远没有好感。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"<I>That</I> is a failing indeed!" -- cried Elizabeth.  "Implacable
resentment <I>is</I> a shade in a character.  But you have chosen
your fault well. -- I really cannot <I>laugh</I> at it; you are safe
from me."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“这倒的的确确是个大缺点！”伊丽莎白大声<BR>
说道。“跟人家怨恨不解，的确是性格上的一<BR>

严格。我的确不能再讥笑你了。你放心好啦。<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some
particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best
education can overcome."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我，相信一个人不管是怎样的脾气，都免不<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to

<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“而你的缺陷呢，”达西笑着回答。“就是故<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Do let us have a little music," -- cried Miss Bingley, tired

<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱小姐眼见这场谈话没有她的份，不禁有<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte
