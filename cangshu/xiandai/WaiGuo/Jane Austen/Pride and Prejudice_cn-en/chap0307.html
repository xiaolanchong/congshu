walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw
the housekeeper coming towards them, and concluding that she
came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her;
but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her
she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for
interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."

there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to
perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your
side, I hope it will not be long before they are.  All that is
required of you is to assure to your daughter, by settlement,
her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your
children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during
your life, one hundred pounds per annum.  These are conditions
which, considering every thing, I had no hesitation in
complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.
I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in
bringing me your answer.  You will easily comprehend, from
these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so
hopeless as they are generally believed to be.  The world has
been deceived in that respect; and, I am happy to say, there
will be some little money, even when all his debts are
discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own
fortune.  If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full
powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this
business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for
preparing a proper settlement.  There will not be the smallest
occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly
at Longbourn, and depend an my diligence and care.  Send back
your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write
explicitly.  We have judged it best that my niece should be
married from this house, of which I hope you will approve.
She comes to us to-day.  I shall write again as soon as any
thing more is determined on.  Your's, &amp;c.

你和姐姐归天以后给她们，那么请你立刻就把<BR>
这位外甥女应得的一份给她吧。你还得和她订<BR>
一个契约，在你生前每年再津贴她一百镑。这<BR>
些条件我已经再三考虑，自以为有权利可以代<BR>
你作主，因此便毫不迟疑地答应了。我特派专<BR>

先生并不如一般人所料想的那么生计维艰，一<BR>

自己名下的钱以外，等韦翰把债务偿清以后，<BR>
还可以多些钱并给她，这使我很高兴。你如果<BR>
愿意根据我所说的情况，让我全权代表你处理<BR>

be married at sixteen! -- My good, kind brother! -- I knew how

to see her!  and to see dear Wickham too!  But the clothes, the
wedding clothes!  I will write to my sister Gardiner about them
directly.  Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him
how much he will give her.  Stay, stay, I will go myself.
Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.  I will put on my things in a

And she was only sixteen last June.  My dear Jane, I am in such
