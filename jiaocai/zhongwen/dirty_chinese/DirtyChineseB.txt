CHAPTER 1 
打招呼
HOWDY CHINESE 

Hello 

Back   in the  day, the  standard   greeting  was “Hi,  Comrade,”  but   thanks  to  the perfidious influence  of the  debauched Taiwanese,  saying that  these days  will  make  you   sound  like  a friend  of  Dorothy to  pretty  much  anyone under  age  50.  There  are  many   ways   to  greet people in China, starting from the more formal “Nin hao” progressing   to  the less  formal  but equally  boring  “Ni hao”  and  ending  up  in  “Wo cao” “Fuck.”   Chinese    greetings   cover    all the 
important facets of life: food, what you are up to, obvious observations on what you  are cur- 
rently in the act of doing, and live bulletins on breaking bowel events. 

      Hi 

      Hey 

        . 

      Have you eaten yet? 

      I’ve got diarrhea.

                                               26/433 

Have you still got diarrhea? 

In traditional Chinese towns, most famil- 
ies didn’t have their own 
toilets, they’d share communal facilities, 
and it was common to 
greet your neighbors as you entered or ex- 
ited the communal 
commodes with “Have you eaten yet?” 
Tasteful! 

’Bout ya? 

----------------------- Page 27-----------------------

                 What’s up? 

Whaddup? 

Slightly   rural-sounding;    can   also   mean 
“WTF?” 

In  some  of  your  more  relaxed  places,  people 
will greet each other with  “gànmá qù?”—liter- 
ally, “What’re  you  doing?”   Unlike  its literal 
English counterpart, “What’s up?” “gànmáqù” 

----------------------- Page 28-----------------------

                                                    28/433 

only has one or two variations—e.g.  “gànmá?” 
More  generally  you  can  say  “How’s  it  goin’?” 
or “       ” This is way more flexible and covers 
greetings  like   “What’s  goin’    down?”    and  the 
equivalent of “How’s it hangin’?” 

     How’s it goin’? 

     How’s it hangin’? 

     Literally, “How’ve you been ‘doing’ it?” 

     How’ve you been lately? 

     Good morning / Good evening. 

----------------------- Page 29-----------------------

                                                  29/433 

There is an informal variation on “good 
morning,”        but not so 
for “good evening.” 

Mornin’. 

    . 

Evenin’! 

Night night. 

----------------------- Page 30-----------------------

             Long time no see 

As  in English, the next part of a greeting usu- 
ally involves  inquiring  about  the  other  per- 
son’s well-being. 

     Been good? 

----------------------- Page 31-----------------------

                                                31/433 

Same as ever. 

You’re still as fat as ever! 

Just as retarded as ever! 

Hey, guys! 

----------------------- Page 32-----------------------

                   Goodbye 

     Zàijiàn 

When  it  comes  to  bidding  farewell,  there  are 
also a few variations on the old “zàijiàn”: 

     Bye-bye. 

     See ya next time. 

----------------------- Page 33-----------------------

                                                    33/433 

I’m off. 

See you ’round. 

----------------------- Page 34-----------------------

                      Hey! 

     Wèi! 

In  British  English,  “oi”  is  a  slightly  impolite 
word    used   to  get   people’s   attention.   In 
Chinese,   “Wèi!”  is  a slightly  impolite  word 
used to get people’s attention, or to answer the 
phone.   Whatever,   if expediency    is key  then 
here’s a few more useful goodies: 

     Come here a sec.

                                                          35/433 

I want to have a word with you. 

----------------------- Page 36-----------------------

                       Me 

In  Chinese  there  are  a variety  of  ways  to  ex- 
press  me,  from  me,  to  me-myself,  to  the  ri- 
diculously   formal,   sometimes    used   in  jest 
“Speaking personally, I,” to the hickish “   ” 

     I myself 

----------------------- Page 37-----------------------

                                               37/433 

Speaking personally, I... 

The above two words are usually used to 
contrast yourself with 
other people, as in sentences like 

                        (Xiànzài 
                                      “Bestiality 
is getting more and more popular 
in Shanghai these days, but I haven’t got 
the taste for it myself.”) 

Ah wanna go home (to the farm)! 

I’m an honest, dependable guy 
worthy of your 
affections. (I want to get into your pants.) 

----------------------- Page 38-----------------------

----------------------- Page 39-----------------------

                      Sorry 

There   are  quite  a few   ways  to  apologize   in 
Chinese. From “I’m sorry” to “I do apologize,” 
there are plenty of ways you can say sorry and 
really  mean  it,  or just shrug  when  you  “acci- 
dentally”  elbow  the  guy  who’s  been  blocking 
the subway doors like he owns the goddamned 
train. 

     My bad. 

----------------------- Page 40-----------------------

                                             40/433 

I do apologize. 

A mistake. 

You’re cool? 

Oops. (Or “Uh-oh.”) 

----------------------- Page 41-----------------------

                   Excuse me 

“Excuse    me”   is  one   of those   multipurpose 
words  that  smooths  over  a  social  faux-pas  or 
vomiting  all over someone’s new leather jack- 
et,  or  it  can  be  an  apology  for  farting.  But  if 
there’s  a  bunch   of  ignorant  fuckers  blocking 
your way  and you want to get past, this is the 
way to deal with them: 

     Coming through! 

----------------------- Page 42-----------------------

                                             42/433 

’Scuse me! 

Beg pardon! 

’Scuse my craphouse Chinese. 

Sorry I’m late. 

----------------------- Page 43-----------------------

                                                   43/433 

Aside from “sorry” and “excuse me,” there are 
a couple other slangy ways to shrug off guilt: 

     You’re so unlucky! (expressing 
     sympathy) 

     It’s all my fault. 

     What a pity. 

     You poor thing. 

----------------------- Page 44-----------------------

                                             44/433 

Watch it! (When it’s someone else’s 
fault.) 

Watch where you’re going! (When 
someone bumps into you.) 

Look out! 

This warning is especially useful if you’re 
flying on your bike 
and some dumbshit just wanders out in 
front of you. This sort 
of apparent utter unawareness of one’s 
surroundings happens 
often enough in China to make you won- 
der how on earth we’ve 
managed to come so far as a species.

                      Please 

Asking  for  a  favor  is  another  of  those  things 
that  you  usually  want  to  be  polite  about.  But 
when you are talking to friends, feel free to be 
a little more casual: 

     When you get the chance... 

----------------------- Page 47-----------------------

                                                 47/433 

give me a call. 

Could you... 

      lend me 100 bucks? 

----------------------- Page 48-----------------------

                                              48/433 

     help get me some toilet paper? 

     Pro Tip: Most toilets in China do not 
     supply toilet paper and 
     97% of foreign travelers find this out 
     the hard way. Be smart— 
     bring your own! 

     help me scratch this itch? 

Could you give me your name? Could 
you?

INTRODUCING YOURSELF 

    My name is Martin. 

    I’m from Nebraska. 

    I’ve got a terminal illness.

                                       50/433 

     And, innocent of the ways of the 
     world, I have never known a 
     woman. 

Could you give me your 
number? 

I’ll join you and your hot friend 
for the night, cool? 

----------------------- Page 51-----------------------

                                         51/433 

I hope we can hang out more. 

You should . . . 

I’m Renee. 

I’m from England. 

I’m woman enough for two men. 

----------------------- Page 52-----------------------

                                         52/433 

I was born a guy... 

...but with the amazing advances in 
medical technology these days... 

Let’s be friends. 

think hard about what you’ve 
done. 

----------------------- Page 53-----------------------

                                          53/433 

     come kick it at my place 
     sometime. 

I’m begging you... 

     I’m begging you, pleeease take a 
     shower, you stink worse than 
     goddamned dog shit! 

----------------------- Page 54-----------------------

                                                        54/433 

Whether      you   are   sitting  next  to    some    over- 
friendly fella from Hebei on the train or you’ve 
been    introduced  to     someone  whose         contacts 
will come in very handy on your business ven- 
ture,  “          ”—“make a friend”—is an all-ter- 
rain phrase  that  will  work  in  any  situation in 
this nation of natural-born networkers. 

----------------------- Page 55-----------------------

                Asking for help 

You’d better learn how to ask for help here in 
China, because despite a change for the better 
in recent years, and the fact that foreigners are 
treated  quite  well  here,  many  people  need  to 
be overtly asked for help before they will offer 
it. 

      Could you help me please? 

----------------------- Page 56-----------------------

                                                    56/433 

      Can you gimme a hand? 

In China, your real friends will always do their 
best  to help you  out if you  are  short  on  cash. 
As  for  other  favors,   your   acquaintances  will 
help  you  with  bureaucratic  issues  if  they  can 
as    it   means     that    some      day    (Brando 
voice)—and     that   day  may    never   come—they 
might just ask a favor of you, too. 

      I’ve gotta pay my rent at the end of 
     the month, but 
      I’m running pretty light on cash. 

----------------------- Page 57-----------------------

                                             57/433 

(Don’t tell them it’s because you spent it 
all on hookers and 
booze.) 

Hey, bro, I got a small prob- 
lem—think you could help me out? 

If you could ... I’d be so grateful! 

Would you mind looking after my 
bag for a moment? 

Use this with caution, i.e., not on the nice 
gentleman from Henan 

----------------------- Page 58-----------------------

                                                   58/433 

who just stuck his hand in your pocket “to 
put back some money 
that you dropped.” 

----------------------- Page 59-----------------------

             Nice to meet you 

This  is what  you’ll see in  pretty much   any 
Chinese textbook, and people do actually say it 
(though   it sounds   a  bit  stilted). A  more 
natural-sounding—not      to   mention    short- 
er—way to say it would be: 

     A pleasure. 

----------------------- Page 60-----------------------

                                              60/433 

Literally, “a fortunate meeting.” 

What’s your surname, (please)? 

Have we met before? 

Got a light? 

(Excuse me,) do you have the time? 

----------------------- Page 61-----------------------

                                               61/433 

Do you come here often? 

Do you want to get a drink? 

How old are you? 

----------------------- Page 62-----------------------

                                          62/433 

No waaaay! You don’t look it! (It’s a 
compliment.) 

How old do you think I look? 

I’m new to China. 

I want to make some Chinese 
friends. 

What do you like to do in your free 
time? 

----------------------- Page 63-----------------------

                                               63/433 

Can you teach me some fun 
Chinese? 

I like hanging out with you. 

----------------------- Page 64-----------------------

        Taking pictures 

Can you take a picture for me? 

Let’s take a group photo. 

----------------------- Page 65-----------------------

                                                65/433 

I don’t like pictures of myself. 

Every language has a word people use 
when they take pictures— 
something long, high-pitched, with an 
“eeeeee” sound in the 
middle of it to stretch people’s faces out 
into a rictus grin. In 
English, it’s “cheese.” In Chinese, it’s 
“eggplant.” 

Cheese! 

Literally, “eggplant.”

FRIENDLY CHINESE

                    Friends 

Meeting  people  is  easy  in  China—from  class- 
mates  who  just  want   to hang   out,  to chatty 
neighbors, to  people who just  want  to try  out 
their English on you, Chinese people treat vis- 
itors  with    a   friendliness   and   kindness 
that—reserved  as  it  may be  at times—is  truly 
surprising for many visitors.  … Unless they’re 
Japanese,   in which   case  history  is personal 
and  immediate.    Oh,  and  don’t  mention    the 
Opium    Wars,   and   you   might   want   to be

Classmates 

     After our finals, I went out with

                    Titles 

It’s  common  in  Chinese to  address people by 
their surname   plus  their profession—sort   of 
the   same   way    as  English   has   “Mayor 
McCheese,”  “Doctor Octopus,” and “Professor 
Snape,” except much more so: Lawyer Zhang, 
Teacher   Wang   (and  there  is nothing  funny 
about   that name),   Director   Lu,  Chairman 
Mao, and so on.

Ever think to yourself,  “Boy, I sure wish there

er’s sister’s son’s  wife’”? Me  neither—but   at 
some point in the development of the Chinese 
language, somebody did. Many of the more ar- 
cane words have  mostly fallen  out of use, but 
even within the immediate family there’s a bit 
more  to  remember  than    there  would  be  for 
English:

           Regional stereotypes 

There   are  some    things  that  everyone    just 
knows:  that   girls  from Sichuan  province    are 
feisty  and   totally  up   for   whatever;    that 
Cantonese people will eat just  about anything; 
that the Shanghainese are prissy little compra- 
dors;  that  Northeasterners     are  all bruisers 
with  volatile  tempers.  Like  most  stereotypes, 
these  are absolutely true.  Here’s a brief  guide 
to regional stereotypes:

                                               93/433 

Beijingers 

Also known as           (  yóuzi; “Beijing 
slickers”) and           (hútòng chuànzi; 
something like “alley rats,” after the 
hútòng alleys that wind through the old 
capital), the Beijingnese are renowned for 
their laziness, their know-it-all attitude, 
and their cheerful willingness to argue 
over just about anything. These qualities 
enabled them to make their marble- 
mouthed slush of a local dialect the basis 
for standard Mandarin. 

Shanghainese

                                              94/433 

No country is complete without a big-city 
rivalry: the U.S. has New York and Los 
Angeles; the U.K. has Manchester and 
Liverpool; China has Beijing and Shang- 
hai, and they hate each other so much. 
The locals call themselves         (Hùshàng; 
“At Hù,” Hù being another name for 
Shanghai) and refer to everyone else as 
     (     de; “in the countryside”). The 
men are known for being more than a bit 
effeminate, and the women are known for 
being impeccably dressed, merciless 
golddiggers. 

Sichuanese 

Sichuan province is home to hot girls, hot 
food, and hot...uh... hot heavy industry in- 
vestment opportunities. A lot of 
Sichuanese leave the province to find 

----------------------- Page 95-----------------------

                                                95/433 

work—often as “hairdressers,” if they’re 
women, or as migrant workers, if they’re 
men. Girls from Sichuan are known for 
their clear skin, fine features, killer bods 
and incomprehensible accents; they’re re- 
ferred to as        (málà     “spicy snatch”) if 
they’re working as prostitutes, or             (là 
mèizi; “spicy sistaz”) if they’re not. 

Northeasterner 

Hailing from Dongbei, the frigid bit of Ch- 
ina stuck between North Korea and Siber- 
ia, Northeasterners generally describe 
themselves as         (     ; 
“extroverted,”“direct,” “fun-loving”), 
while people from elsewhere in the coun- 
try typically describe them as “alcoholics 
prone to violent outbursts” and assume 
them to be affiliated with organized

                                                  96/433 

crime. This is unfair. Dongbei guys make 
great drinking buddies, if you’re a guy (if 
you’re a girl, you may want to carry pep- 
per spray), and they’re good to have on 
your side in a fight. And with their big 
hair, heavy war-paint, piercing accents, 
negotiable virtue and square-headed boy- 
friends, Dongbei chicks are like the Jersey 
girls of China. 

----------------------- Page 97-----------------------

                     Types 

In America,  you  have your  classic personality 
archetypes—preppy       kids,   hipsters,   nerds, 
geeks,   goths,  punks,   hippies,   backpackers, 
rednecks.   China  has  no  shortage   of its own 
colorful set of pleasing titles. 

     The Big Spender 

----------------------- Page 98-----------------------

                                              98/433 

Frequently seen carrying a pleather man- 
purse, sporting a flat-top haircut and 
speaking loudly into his oversized cell- 
phone, the Big Spender (literally, “sud- 
denly wealthy” or “nouveau riche”) has 
done well for himself, probably in some 
grim former state-owned enterprise, and 
he’s keen to let everyone, particularly his 
rented KTV arm candy, know about it. 

The Arm Candy 

Big Spenders will often appear at dinner 
with young, attractive women who are 
neither their wives nor their “second 
wives.” These young women are the             ( 
   ; “little honey”—“mì” comes from the 
English “Miss”), a category that falls 
somewhere between “piece on the side” 
and “arm candy,” since they’re not even 

----------------------- Page 99-----------------------

                                                 99/433 

necessarily banging the guy they’re with. 
Identifiable by: apparent belief that 
speaking like a four-year-old is sexy, high 
incidence of sentence-final interjective 
particles, age disparity between them and 
the dude whose lap they’re sitting on. 

The Kept Woman 

----------------------- Page 100-----------------------

                                              100/433 

Unlike Arm Candy, Kept Women are en- 
gaged in serious, long-term relationships, 
playing the role of “second wife.” The men 
they’re involved with frequently not only 
      (     “take” second wives), they         ( 
“look after”) them, buying apartments for 
them, paying living costs, and even paying 
school tuition for their children if there 
are any. It’s actually pretty stand-up of 
the guys, until you remember that they’re 
still cheating on their real wives. 

The Yuppie 

Often heard before they are seen, Yuppies 
(literally, “white collars” in Chinese) are 
the ones in line behind you at Star- 
bucks—they’d never go to SPR or any of 
the other local chains—dropping English 
words conspicuously into their sentences, 

----------------------- Page 101-----------------------

                                              101/433 

talking about real estate and stocks, and 
buying cars they can’t afford and vaca- 
tions that will bring them no joy in a sad 
attempt to fill the gaping holes at the core 
of their being. Fun game: next time you 
talk on the phone with a Chinese person, 
use English for all the words you don’t 
know in Chinese and see if you get mis- 
taken for one of these guys. 

The Slacker 

You know slackers back home? The same 
with these guys. At high risk of being in 
rock bands and having poor haircuts. 

The Busybody 

----------------------- Page 102-----------------------

                                              102/433 

The eyes, ears and especially mouths of 
the neighborhood grapevine, Busybodies 
are small, formidable dolmen-shaped old 
women with severe perms and flower- 
print blouses. Having done their bit for 
the Revolution, they now spend their re- 
tirement sitting around the yards of 
apartment developments talking to one 
another, observing neighbors’ children 
approvingly and getting all up in people’s 
business. They’re not malicious; they just 
grew up without TV. Literally known as 
“the small-footed search-and-arrest 
squad,” they can frequently be seen just 
watching. Get on their good side, 
seriously. 

The Poser 

----------------------- Page 103-----------------------

                                              103/433 

Literally “poser cunt perpetrator,” the 
Poser thrives in his or her natural habitat 
of upscale cafes and art galleries. Readily 
identifiable by emo glasses, Buddhist 
prayer beads around their wrists and their 
tendency to name-drop whatever foreign 
writer is fashionable at the moment, they 
seek potential mates by talking endlessly 
about how they went to Lhasa and found 
it so spiritual that they’d like nothing bet- 
ter than to give up their apartment, car 
and Macbook and spend the rest of their 
lives living in a yak-hide tent eating noth- 
ing but tsampa and drinking nothing but 
yak-butter tea. Note: may have never ac- 
tually been to Lhasa. 

The Migrant Worker

                                              104/433 

The unsung, perpetually fucked-over hero 
behind China’s economic miracle, the mi- 
grant worker (occasionally             (nóngmín 
   or “rural migrant worker”) leaves his or 
her horrible little hometown somewhere 
in the heartland to come to the big city 
and work long hours at dangerous, low- 
paying jobs to send money to their family 
back home. Hygiene and manners are fre- 
quently unfamiliar concepts for these 
guys, and you’ll hear city dwellers be- 
moaning their crudeness, but give them a 
break and be friendly if you meet 
them—God knows they’ve earned it.

         Let’s go have some fun! 

It’s  a  big  ol’  country,  and  depending  on  who 
you  are,  where  you    are and  what  your    pur- 
chasing  power    is, the  local  interpretation   of 
partying can range from sculling sorghum rot- 
gut  out  of  paper  cups   and  playing   checkers 
outside a grocery store to bumping and grind- 
ing (or at least trying to) at a club serving com- 
plimentary    pitchers  of  green  tea  and  Chivas 
Regal to—if you are, say, the former vice-May- 
or  of  Beijing—getting     a  house    out  in  the

suburbs, stocking it up with toothsome young 
things from Guizhou and spending your week- 
ends  ripped to  the  tits  on  amphetamines  and 
Viagra  and  getting  freak-ay.  From the  corner 
store   to the   dance   floor,  from    the  24-hour 
“barbershop”  to     the  Pussy   Palace,  from    sip- 
ping   and   chugging     to  snorting   and   toking, 
there’s more than just one Party in China.

The Chinese have more words for 
singing karaoke than the Eskimos do 
for snow. The latest and greatest, the 
yuppiest of the yuppie, is         (chàng 
K; “sing K”), where “K” is short for 
“KTV.”

This place is dead—let’s move this 
party somewhere else. 

I might as well go home early and 
pleasure myself. 

In Chinese this actually means either “this 
place sucks!” or “I’m 
really tired.” 

I/I’m... 

     feel like partying.

I don’t give a fuck.

Your  Chinese friends  will  feel  obliged to  take 
you  out  every  night,  but  after  getting  fucked 
up   two   nights   in  a   row,  they—like     your- 
self—don’t  necessarily  feel  like  going  out, but 
they’ll take you  out anyway...unless you  make 
it clear that although you’d love to chug beers 
and   pitchers   of green   tea  and   Scotch,   even 
rack up a couple of lines of K, you really need 
to  rest  in  order  to  restore  your  health.  They 
too  will  sigh   with   relief. But   perhaps    you

should invite them to chill with you—after  all, 
they have been gracious hosts. 

     I’m so wasted, I can’t go out 
     again—I’ll get a cold if I do. 

     I’m just gonna take it easy, you want 
     to go for a foot massage? 

     I’m not going nowhere—I went way

express  awesomeness,  but  in  China  you  only 
need       (   “cow-cunt”)  which  means  all  of 
the above.

       Where Chinese go to play 

After  dinner  the  question  is  bound   to arise: 
where to from here fellow comrades? Chinese, 
young  and not so young, hang anywhere from 
pool  halls, pubs/clubs    and  karaoke   to  bath 
houses,  massage  parlors  and  Internet  cafes... 
The list is huge. 

     Foot massage 

----------------------- Page 132-----------------------

                                                 132/433 

You’re hammered from a killer baijiu ses- 
sion at dinner, so your hosts may take you 
to a foot massage parlor to relax—defin- 
itely not for the ticklish. These places gen- 
erally don’t offer oil change. 

Karaoke (tame) 

This type of establishment is the usual 
choice after dinner, or even after the mid- 
night snack after the club. Most people

here will be getting pretty wasted, but 
these establishments are considered to be 
wholesome venues—the type you could 
bring your kids to. 

”Nightclub” (the kind with sex, 
drugs and schmaltz- 
pop karaoke) 

Your standard         is a scandalous den of 
debauchery. It has a night club, private 
karaoke rooms and a selection of scantily 
clad women and men to pleasure you be- 
hind closed doors. At some of them you 
can even score your drugs of choice and 
get all Chris Farley on their asses (without 
the heart attack). 

Pub

                                              134/433 

Pubs have a mostly Western (expatriate) 
clientele, but there’s no shortage of 
Anglophone locals either. Pretty girls in 
short skirts everywhere you look. 

Club 

The music is usually shite, but there are 
plenty of women for hire at the local 
clubs. Of course the big cities like Beijing, 
Shanghai and Guangzhou (Canton) have 
international standard clubs with the 
latest DJs from all over the world, plenty 
of fun, not to mention a wide selection of 
exotic international whores (and man 
whores).

Pool hall 

Chilled out local pool halls are usually 
packed in the afternoons, 
many of them are actually outdoors. 
You’ll find them the busiest 
just before dinner time. 

Mahjong room 

You pay a fee, you play mahjong, you lose, 
you leave. Legal so long as you’re not 
gambling real money, wink-wink. 

Bath house (with the option of sex 
for hire)

                                              136/433 

Many Chinese hosts will take you to the 
bathhouse to relax in a communal, naked, 
manly atmosphere, and if you’re lucky 
they organize prostitutes for your added 
relaxation. 

Barbershop 

Ah, the “barbershops.” There are legitim- 
ate hair salons aplenty, but we’re talking 
here about the ones with no scissors or 
combs—just lots of pink neon, bored girls, 
hand lotion and flexible operating hours.

            Booze and firewater 

China   offers  a  wide   variety  of  places,  sub- 
stances  and  amounts  to  drink.  In  bars  you’ll 
find all of the stuff you’re used to from home. 
In   other  contexts    you   may    encounter 
(báijiŭ; literally,  “white liquor”), the  choice of 
taxi  drivers    and   discriminating     alcoholics 
everywhere.    Some    people   will  tell you  that 
baijiu means “white wine,” but don’t fall for it. 
It’s  usually distilled  from  sorghum     at  some-

Your  typical  Chinese  drinking  sesh  combines 
aspects      of   the     sprint     (sipping      is   for 
pussies—real  men  drain  their  cups  every  GO 
GO GO) and the marathon. It is a long, unend- 
ing  slog  that  tends  to  leave  you  with  chafed, 
bleeding     nipples.    Sometimes       you’ve    got   to 
slow things down a bit: 

      Just half a glass!

Both of these words for draft beer are in 
common use. As a general rule of thumb,

Authorial opinion is divided as to the 
merits of rice wine. It’s usually served 
heated, results in a nice warm buzz, 
and despite the relatively low alcohol 
content—about 10% Alc/ Vol., can be

         (pútao; or “grape”) is important 
     when ordering white 
     wine. It’s all that stands between you 
     and a snoot full of       (báijiŭ; 
     “sorghum wine”). If ordering red, 
     though, it’s optional. China has be- 
     gun producing its own wine, only 
     some of which tastes like cough syr- 
     up. Following the recent poison-wine 
     scandal in China, we foreigners now 
     have an airtight excuse to avoid enga-

For most of the general population, there’s not

you’re  in  any  big city  like Beijing,  Shanghai, 
Guangzhou or even Changsha—to say nothing 
of  Yunnan      province,   where    weed    grows 
wild—the  local  party  people  are  getting  high

Chinese   ideals  of  beauty  have   changed   over

the  chubby  skank  of  a  concubine who  helped 
ruin the Tang dynasty, to deliberately crippled 
women with three-inch          (   “golden lotus”) 
feet, to the severely pigtailed model workers of 
the Mao years, to the relatively normal stand- 
ards  of  today.  As  you  may  have  heard,  there

Some  people  will  tell  you  that  it’s  impossible 
to  say objectively that  something is  “good” or 
“bad,”   that  it’s  all a  continuum,     and   that 
everything’s relative, and that what seems bad 
to you may be perfectly good for someone else. 
Fuck  these   people.  These    people  have    never

Farting    (      ,  fàngpì;   literally, “releasing

of bullshitting  you?  That’s  “dogfart.” Want  to 
refer  to  the  release  of  intestinal  gas  through 
the rectum? That’s farting too. Just remember, 
as Confucius did not say:                  (biérén pì 
chòu   zìj? pì  xiāng):  The   farts  of  others  are 
stinky, my own farts are fragrant.

    Traditional Chinese medicine 

                    (TCM) 

Traditional forms of Chinese medicine are be- 
coming increasingly popular in Western coun- 
tries. However,  along  with  this new  wave   of 
coolness  comes   a  whole   new  generation   of 
charlatans. When practiced properly, the doc- 
tors will prescribe various  concoctions of nat- 
ural ingredients that are cooked up into a foul- 
tasting brew. Traditional Chinese herbal medi- 
cine  doesn’t  produce  an  obvious   immediate

effect, but you’ll usually feel a difference by the 
second day. TCM aims to attack the root cause 
of  your  ailments  and  to  boost  your      immune 
system  over  time,  whereas  Western  medicine 
attacks  the  symptoms  and  produces  quicker, 
short-term relief. 

     Acupuncture and moxibustion 

     Literally, “needle”        ) and “scorch” (     ). 
     The doctor turns you into a pin cushion or 
     burns little mounds of mugwort on your 
     body in order to heal you. Sounds creepy, 
     but it apparently works. 

     Pressure points / acupuncture

These are the points that are situated on 
the meridians (        ,    ), the lines upon 
which “qi” flows throughout the body. 
You may think of these in terms of the 
points Spock uses for the Vulcan nerve 
pinch.

They light a fire inside the cup to suck out 
the air and create a vacuum, then apply it 
to your back or ass. This creates better 
circulation of “qi” and sucks out toxins. 

Scraping 
Guāshā 

Here they move the cups that are already

go for the male G-spot.

From “boning” to  “getting laid”  and “a roll in

language  offers  more  colorful  idioms  and  eu- 
phemisms  to  describe  “fucking” than you  can 
shake a stick at. From “fucking a cunt” to “fry- 
ing rice,” Mandarin also offers up a “fat” selec- 
tion of ways to describe the act of fornication. 
Of  course,  dear  debaucher,  you  must  choose 
carefully which ones to use when trying to get 
someone    into  the  sack, and   which   ones  for

People  will  likely  point  out  that     is  pretty 
heavy     artillery,  language-wise,      and     it’s 
true—it’s  about  as  harsh  as  “cunt.”  And   gets 
used the same way, a lot of the time. Here are 
some softer ways  of referring to the holiest  of 
holies:

                  Gay Chinese 

Attitudes  toward  homosexuality  have  taken  a 
number of twists and turns over the millennia. 
An old story recounts the tenderness of an em- 
peror  for  a  male  courtier  whom  he  loved     so 
much  that  when  his  beloved’s      sleeping  head 
pinned  down  a  sleeve  of his  gown,  he  cut  off 
the sleeve rather than risk waking the man up 
by moving it, leading to the lovely classical eu- 
phemism           (       )—“the love that  cut off 
its  sleeve.”  A  later classical  term,      (

“Longyang’s     vice”),  is  rather  more    negative, 
coming  as  it  does  from  the  tale  of  a  famous 
catamite. And  until just      a  few  years  ago,  ho- 
mosexuality was against the law and could get 
you   fired  from  your  work     unit  or  signed  up 
quick    for  electroshock     therapy.    Times    are 
turning,  though,  and while  there’s  still plenty 
of  prejudice—and  the  traditional  family  pres- 
sures   to  marry   and   have   children—the      new 
generation is developing a vibrant, proud sub- 
culture   and   increasingly    winning    acceptance 
from   mainstream      society.   Hell,  everyone    in 
the government’s a “comrade.”

Insults are for the highly skilled, Grasshopper. 
It’s best  not to  shoot your  wad  too  early  in  a 
cuss-off—start small, end big. In Chinese argu- 
ments, as in any form of diplomacy, proper es- 
calation is key. 

Dropping F-Bombs1 is no way to argue in Ch- 

ina.  In  fact  dirty  cussing  should be  a last  re- 
sort,  to  be   used    only   when    the   situation    is 
hopeless  and one has  no care for maintaining 
dignity,    or  a  bloodbath      will  most     certainly 
follow. 

The  best    and  most  effective  personal  insults 
are  derived  from  knowing  someone  (superfi- 
cially) enough to describe their weaknesses in

means if you  take  on  one, you’ll  be  taking  on 
everyone     in   the  vicinity.   More     importantly, 
you represent all Westerners—try not to make 
us look any worse than we already do!

             POPPY CHINESE 

When  talking  about  Chinese  pop  culture  and 
its quality relative to American  pop culture, it 
may be instructive to think of cheese. Imagine 
that  Elvis  is  a wheel   of  fine  aged   Asiago 
cheese, that  New  Kids on the  Block  are  Kraft 
singles, that Avril  Lavigne is  a block  of neon- 
orange   mild   cheddar   you   got  at  the  7-11. 
Chinese pop culture is Easy Cheese. What with 
all of the fuss  about China having  5000 years

of  history     and   all  that,   people     listening    to 
Chinese  music for  the  first  time  might be  ex- 
cused for wondering how  a culture capable of 
inventing gunpowder and creating some of the 
world’s finest literature and cuisine could suck 
so bad on the music end of things.

Chinese  comedy tends  to  come  in  one  of two 
major    flavors:  the  traditional   northern 
(xiàngsheng; “cross-talk”), which  is  similar in 
structure   and  humor    content  to  a  couple   of 
early-morning     AM    radio  hosts   deprived    of 
their  palette  of  funny  sound  effects,  and  the 
more recent, often Cantonese-language mo lei 
tau (     , wúlítóu) comedy typified by Stephen 
Chow  and  other  Hong  Kong  comedians,  who

While online censorship in China 
isn’t the totalitarian affair many ima- 
gine, there are some words—espe- 
cially words of the naughty vari- 
ety—that get screened out by many 
forums and blog sites. This postfacto 
screening is known as 
“harmonizing”—          (héxié)—a play 
on the government’s stated policy of 
building a “harmonious society” ( 

     , héxiéshèhuì).

                                        321/433 

For years Chinese Internet users got 
around keyword-based censorship by 
substituting homophonous charac- 
ters, like “river crab” (     , héxiè), a 
rough homophone for “harmony.” 
People had fun with this for a while, 
but didn’t do much with it until more 
recently, when netizens came up with 
a whole menagerie of imaginary, ho- 
mophonous animals—including the 
“grass mud horse”                or “Fokk 
Ewe,” a rough homophone for “fuck 
your mother”                There fol- 
lowed a whole imaginary zoological 
study of the “grass mud horse” that 
found that it lived in the “Gobi ass- 
hurt” (        ,     ; “Horse-bit Gobi”), 
a rough homophone for              ( 
“your mother’s cunt”), and was en- 
gaged in a constant battle for its sur- 
vival against the perfidious river 
crabs. This gave rise to 
Photoshopped, LOLCats-like pictures

legalized again once they realized there

           HUNGRY CHINESE 

Food   is  of paramount     importance    to  the 
Chinese.   It’s rare   that  you’ll  bump    into 
someone    you  know    and  NOT    ask  them  if 
they’ve  eaten yet.  If you’re  on  a  trip  and  un- 
sure  what   souvenir  to bring  back   for your 
Chinese  buddies,  just  buy  some   edible  local 
specialty  and  you’re  set. They  love  food  so 
much here, they extended their borders just  so

the  map    of  China   would    be  shaped    like  a 
chicken. 

First-time visitors to  China often worry  about 
food   poisoning.    They   soon   learn   that   like 
death and taxes, food poisoning is basically in- 
evitable.  After   a few   meals,   though,   they’re 
well   on   their   way    to  having    bowels     of 
steel—provided they don’t drink the tap water.

                       Food 

The  Chinese  have  multiple  names  for  rice.  It 
plays  such an important  role in  Chinese gast- 
ronomy  that  cooked  rice  is  synonymous  with 
food   in  general.  The   weirdest   thing   is that 
when  you’ve  stuffed  yourself  full  with  all  the 
awesome food laid out on the table in front of 
you,  you’ll  be  asked  what  you’d  like  for  your 
main   meal.   And   you   thought    you’d   already 
stuffed  yourself   enough  for  five  main  meals! 
The Chinese believe that unless you eat rice or

other  staples  such  as  noodles  or  dumplings, 
you can’t actually feel fully satisfied. For them, 
the staples are the main meal, everything else 
is just condiments.

                   Hurry up! 

       ? 

Because the most common dishes in China are 
pretty quick to prepare, most Chinese have be- 
come accustomed to getting their meals pretty 
damn  quick.  So  don’t be  surprised  when  you 
hear   people   everywhere     in every   restaurant 
screaming    at  the  waiter   to  tell the  cook   to 
hurry the fuck up. You don’t tip here, so don’t 
expect the wait staff to bend over backward to 
give  you  good  service.  In  fact,  the  wages  are 

----------------------- Page 375-----------------------

                                                   375/433 

pretty low, so if you get a smile, you’re already 
doing pretty good. 

     Waiter / Waitress... 

     Note that it’s safest, especially in North- 
     ern China, to address the waitress with 
     the gender-neutral term                  rather 
     than          “Miss”) as is common in the 
     south. You see, besides meaning “Miss,” 
             is also a relatively common term for 
     a bar girl. It depends on who’s speaking, 
     and it’s no longer as touchy as it used to 
     be, but if you drop a            up north, you 
     may offend. 

           we want to order!

                                      376/433 

Follow the pattern: call out for the 
wait staff in a loud voice, 
then make your request. 

what do you recommend (to 
eat)? 

            ? 

how much does this cost? 

       ? 

are the portions large?

coffeeshops. Actually, coffee culture 
is huge here—but as a rule, it’s post- 
Starbucks café culture, not the Old 
World incubator of ideas/informa- 
tion exchange. 

     Starbucks 

     These are everywhere in China, 
     even at one point (though no 
     longer) in the Forbidden City. 
     Expect no surprises. The clien- 
     tele are mostly wannabe young 
     Chinese professionals, brand- 
     conscious Taiwanese, and 
     Korean housewives.

SPR 

These “Shanzhai Starbucks” are 
popping up all over China like 
mushrooms after a spring rain. 
The logo looks like Starbucks, 
the coffee is cheaper and they 
have free wi-fi—’nuff said. The 
clientele either come because of 
brand recognition (albeit the 
wrong brand) or because they 
are Westerners who have lived 
here long enough to know that 
anything “Shanzhai” is cool 
(counter-culture-cum-main- 
stream) and they want to be cool 
too. Either that, or they just 
prefer the cheaper coffee.

     You know how there are some res- 
     taurants where they’ve got “atmo- 
     sphere” and thick, sound-cancelling 
     carpets and you feel like you have to 
     whisper your order so people don’t

           International cuisine 

We’ve  already established that food is the pil- 
lar  of  existence  in  China.  These  people  have 
been  coming up with  new ways to  eat shit for 
millennia. Although they can have some pretty 
weird   ideas  of what   tastes  good,   there’s  so 
much  variety  here  you’ll  find  plenty  of  good 
eats—whatever your tastes.

     Curry 

     We all know that curry is a combination 
     of spices, and what passes for curry in Ch- 
     ina is a generic yellow powder not unlike 
     Japanese curry. Never fear: authentic In- 
     dian cuisine is becoming more common 
     in China, and any major city should have 
     passable Indian restaurants.

     Spaghetti

                                                    388/433 

      Literally, “Italian noodles.” The fact that 
      spaghetti—usually spaghetti bo- 
     lognaise—represents “Italian noodles” in- 
      dicates that the average Zhang doesn’t 
     know much about real Italian pasta. Al- 
      though you can more or less scratch an 
      itch by eating “Italian noodles” at most 
      Chinese-style Western restaurants, expect 
      it to be about on a par, authenticity-wise, 
     with the Kung Pao chicken you’d get at an 
      Italian restaurant. 

Thai food

Thai is available in big Chinese cities, but most 
Thai    restaurants     have    Chinese     chefs   and 
Chinese owners, and stick to bland versions of 
the standards. 

Japanese food 

There  are plenty  of  real Japanese  restaurants 
in  China, but  the  numerous  RMB  150 all you 
can  eat  and  drink  Teppanyaki  buffets  are  by 
far the most popular among locals  and expats 
alike. 

Korean food

Like  Japanese  food,  Korean  restaurants  exist 
in   every    Chinese      city   with    a  decent-sized 
Korean population. A  lot  of  Korean BBQs are 
run by  ethnically  Korean  Chinese,  sometimes 
with North Korean staff.

                    Fast food 

All  the  usual  suspects  can  be  found  in  every 
major  and  not  so  major  city.  It’s  not  unusual 
to  see  multiple   McDonalds,     KFCs   and   Pizza 
Huts on a single intersection in busy shopping 
areas in huge cities like Beijing and Shanghai. 
If  you  didn’t  have  sensory  overload  yet,  you 
will when you  notice all the  Chinese fast food 
joints  doing huge business right alongside the 
global players.

of  the  major  International  chains,  sometimes 
with   names    like  McKFC                 these   are 
usually crap, but some are even better than the 
originals.   Chinese   fast  food   chains   serve   up 
huge  selections  of local  (fast) food—fast  even 
by  the  generally    zippy   standards    of Chinese 
restaurants.

healthiest fast food choice in China, 
as the food is all steamed—noodles, 
pork ribs, vegetables, etc. Why call it 
Kung-Fu? Could be that

but way cooler.

These are everywhere in China and 
are inexplicably popular. The noodles 
are instant, the steamed buns are du- 
bious, the “fresh” soy milk isn’t—but 
somehow they manage to keep the 
customers coming. Some of the older 
stores retain the franchise’s old logo: 
a Chinese Colonel Sanders.

Xinianlai 

This is an okay destination for break- 
fast: they serve Cantonese and 
Taiwanese snacks        (    ; otherwise 
known as dim sum) for a decent 
price. The food here will not blow you 
away, but it’s a safe bet when you’re 
hung-over or don’t feel like any kind 
of gastronomical excitement. 

Kentucky Fried Chicken 

Known as KFC here in the Middle 
Kingdom, KFC is more popular than 
MickeyD’s. Maybe it’s because they 
got here early; maybe it’s because the

Colonel’s beard and glasses mark him 
as a man of learning and cultivation; 
maybe it’s because Chinese tend to 
prefer chicken and pork to dark 
meats. KFC has localized its offerings 
to a greater extent than McDonald’s 
has, and the Macao-style egg-custard 
tarts are pretty tasty. 

Kendeli 

A fine introduction to knock-off or 
“Shanzhai” culture (        ,    ), Kendeli 
is a small Chinese fried-chicken fran- 
chise that can be found in county 
seats, small towns, and 3rd tier cities 
(these cities may have KFC, but 
Kendeli is cheaper). Not that bad, but 
every now and then you may get mild 
food poisoning from it.

     Another “Shanzhai”(         ,    ) KFC

     a weekly event if you are living out in 
     the boonies with no Western food at 
     all. They wanted to call it “Clown

     “Clam Burger” instead.

Chinese McDonald’s is just like every oth- 
er McDonald’s in the world, but they 
speak Chinese. Ronald McDonald is 
called          (         ; “Uncle McDon-

as creepy as the fact that the waitresses 
used to be called           (       “Auntie 
McDonald”). 

Chinese Burger Home 

This is the “Shanzhai” McDonald’s from 
back before the word “Shanzhai” (              ) 
meant “knock-off.” A lot of them use 
McDonald’s equipment, and if you eat 
here you’ll be getting basically the same 
food at half the price.

                Chinese food 

Every  small  town  in  China  has  its  own  local 
food  variants,  but  the  most  popular  regional 
cuisines are represented in every city. 

     Let’s go out and eat some… 

          Sichuan food (Szechwan) 

----------------------- Page 399-----------------------

                                       399/433 

Sichuan cuisine is known as         (málà; 
numb and spicy). The numb part 
comes from the abundance of 
Sichuan peppercorns that tease you 
by turning up the heat and then 
numbing your mouth so you can’t 
feel anything. Sichuan cuisine is one 
of the most popular Chinese regional 
cuisines, both domestically and inter- 
nationally. You can find Sichuan res- 
taurants everywhere, but if you want 
authentic levels of heat you have to 
ask for it—they think non-Sichuanese 
folk are chile pussies.

Hunan Food 

They say the Hunanese are actually afraid 
of eating non-spicy-hot food. Perhaps 
even more than Sichuan food (which oc- 
casionally offers dishes that don’t bring 
tears to the eye), this is seriously not for 
the delicate of tummy. Hunan food has all 
the flavors: sour, salty, sweet, bitter and 
always SPICY HOT. If you are a serious 
spice freak, ask for extra hot and it will 
make your head ring, without the feeling 
of having the inside of your mouth peel 
off that Thai chiles will give you. 

Shanghai food

                                               401/433 

Renowned for its elegance, Shanghai 
cuisine is a lesson in subtlety—which is to 
say that it’s oily and bland, but also over- 
priced. These people put sugar in vinegar. 

Northeastern food (Manchurian) 

As rough and hearty as the Northeastern- 
ers themselves, Northeastern food is 
heavy on potatoes, glass noodles, meat 
and dumplings. If a thing can be stewed, 
it’s safe to say that the Northeasterners 
have tried it. Great stuff when you’re 
hungry or when (as is so often the case in 
Northeastern China) it’s thirty degrees 
below zero out.

Cantonese food 

The Cantonese pride themselves on their 
cuisine, which offers a variety and delic- 
acy not found in other Chinese regional 
cuisines. They’re the ones who brought 
the world dim sum—and the ones whose 
cuisine is blamed for starting SARS a few 
years back. If it walks, slithers, flies, 
swims or otherwise draws breath, some 
Cantonese person somewhere has dedic- 
ated an amazing amount of thought to 
eating it.

Xinjiang food 

Xinjiang Uyghur food is more Central Asi- 
an than Chinese—a melange of Silk Road 
dishes and flavors. There are Xinjiang 
restaurants everywhere in China with a 
charcoal kebab grill at the front and at 
least one or two visibly Uyghur staff in 
view. If it’s a halal (        ) Xinjiang

restaurant you will get the real 
deal—steaming fresh rounds of           (  ) flat- 
bread and roast mutton. 

Hotpot 

Hotpot involves a metal pot of simmering 
broth placed in the middle of the table 
(usually a concoction of herbs, spices and 
stock). You order up fresh vegetables, 
meats, seafood, seaweed, noodles, dump- 
lings and soybean products (                ) and 
you dip the food you want to eat into the 
pot, cook it, then place it the bowl in front 
of you. There are plenty of dipping sauces 
to choose from. While the tastiest hotpots 
are spicy hot, you can order not-spicy hot- 
pots, or you can get the divided pot (half 
spicy/half non-spicy).

Chongqing hotpot (Chungking 
hotpot) 

There are many different Chongqing hot- 
pot chains and they are all pretty hit and 
miss, so you may as well just try your 
luck. Chongqing hotpot is said to be the 
spiciest of all hotpots, so if you can’t 
handle chile, this is not for you: some of 
the places offer mild chicken broth, but 
that’s really defeating the purpose. If you 
are hell bent on having the authentic 
Chongqing experience, or are otherwise 
into pain, ask for extra-spicy (            . If 
you have decided to end it all in as spec- 
tacular a manner as possible—think spon- 
taneous combustion—ask for “super-very- 
really-fuckinghot’” (

Little Sheep Mongolian hotpot (aka, 
Little Fat Sheep) 

This hotpot chain is so popular it has 
crossed the Pacific and can now be found 
at North American locations, and even 
Australia! If you’re not sure whether to 
eat the spicy or non-spicy, go for the 
“Half-Half” hotpot (                2).

                      Snacks 

Listen, save yourself  some time  and deal with 
the issue of kitchen hygiene the same way you 
deal with death and clowns: don’t think about 
it. You might, as some do, opt to eat only at big 
and    expensive    restaurants    because     you’re 
afraid  of  getting  food  poisoning;  the  truth  is 
that the kitchens are just  about the same any- 
where  you  go,  whether  it’s  a  hole-in-the-wall 
chow mein (             joint  or a hotel’s banquet 
hall. Better  to  eat  at  the  place  you  know    is

dirty than at the place where you can’t see the 
dirt. 

The best thing about eating out in China is the 
vibrant  culture  and  awesome  food  you’ll  find 
at  the  night  markets  and  street  vendors.  Al- 
though  most  night  markets  manifest  at  fixed 
locations, they can potentially exist anywhere. 
A  couple  of  food  vendors  with  their  whole  al 
fresco  tricycle-mounted  kitchens  gathering  in 
one   spot  is   essentially    a mini    night   market. 
Here are  some  of the  choices  at your  average 
night    market     or   street   stall   snack    vendor 
(these vary with region):

                                        409/433 

This is considered by most Western 
people who like to drink as the ulti- 
mate drunk food, usually operated by 
Uygur or Hui (ethnically Chinese 
Muslims), often strategically located 
near bars and clubs. “Mutton” is 
probably an optimistic description of 
what’s being sold here, but it’s tasty 
all the same. 

Street BBQ 

Although Xinjiang kebabs are the 
most well known type of street snack 
among the Westerners fresh off the 
boat, the Chinese really dig their gen- 
eral BBQ. You can choose almost any

vegetable available to be char grilled 
(the safer option if you are worried 
about the meat that’s been sitting in 
the Styrofoam box all night in the 
middle of summer), or chicken 
wings, hearts, squid, fish, etc., for 
meat eaters. Get a bunch of friends, 
grab a table with the little plastic 
chairs, order a shitload of beer, 
maybe even get a keg if it’s a large 
night market. If your are flying solo, 
just wait till some curious locals start 
calling out “Hello!” then refer to 
“Angry Chinese” and call them stu- 
pid. They’ll be shocked at first, then 
laugh, then invite you over to join in 
on the BBQ madness. You will get ex- 
tremely drunk.

Spicy flash-boiled things 

Málàtáng is from Chongqing 
(formerly part of Sichuan Province). 
You pick out the fresh ingredients 
you want from the fridge—bamboo 
shoots, meat balls, various tofu itera- 
tions, greens, shrooms, seaweed 
(yeah, you get the idea)—putting 
them in a basket as you go. Pay first, 
then they put all your shit into a steel 
basket and submerge it in the bub- 
bling spicy soup in the 40-gallon

drum. When it’s cooked they add the 
chile oil, and the fried chile flakes 
(optional), your choice of garlic, cil- 
antro and spring onion. Málàtáng can 
be found everywhere in China, but 
the most authentic is made by 
Chongqingers. If you can speak 
Chinese, just talk to the boss and 
listen for the lilting Sichuan accent 
(they sound like Chinese lepre- 
chauns). Don’t think too hard about 
the sanitation. 

Shengjian (pan-fried pork buns) 

Shengjian is a Yangtze River delta 
street food. They make the little pork 
buns, then put them in a huge shal- 
low pan of bubbling oil (enough to fry 
only the bottom of the bun). Cover

the pan with a bamboo lid and then 
violently rotate the pan every minute. 
Don’t be surprised if you have to 
queue up for these. Be careful of the 
hot juices sealed inside the 
buns—eating them is harder than it 
looks, but you’ll figure it out after the 
first few times you burn your lips.

                  Weird shit 

In  Beijing you’ll  see the  starfish  and scorpion 
kebabs   at  the  “official”  food  street  in  Wang- 
fujing. If you  really want bragging  rights back 
home, skip the touristy gimmicks (locals don’t 
even   eat   them)    and   eat  authentic    weird 
shit—some     of it actually  tastes  good!  When 
your Chinese friends ask you what you feel like 
for  dinner, tell  ’em you want to try their local 
“peasant  food”  (       . This  could  turn  out  to 
be  the  best  Chinese  food  you’ve  ever  had—if

not the best, then  at least the most authentic. 
Amongst the fairly normal looking food, you’ll 
be served up stuff more suited to the “Temple 
of  Doom”  banquet.  This  is  weird  shit  in  real 
context. 

Now there’s weird  and there’s weird  (by non- 
Chinese standards). You gotta understand that 
for the Chinese, nothing is weird, so if you ask 
’em if you’re  about to  eat weird  local  special- 
ties  (               ; literally,  “unusual  local  fla- 
vors”), they’ll honestly say no.

exotic, not to mention protected, 
creatures, his reply was lightning fast: 
“It’s simple—if it is alive, if it breathes, I

to be lying on my deathbed knowing that 
in my life I’d passed up the opportunity to 
eat something I’d not yet tried.”

             About the Authors 

Matt  Coleman  is  a  Univeristy  of  Queensland 
Chinese Language graduate who has spent six 
years in China—long enough to know that un- 
derstanding foul language  is a very  important 
and  essential  skill  that  must  be  used  wisely. 
He likes  China,  spicy  food,  and  Scotch  single 
malt whiskeys.  He wants  to  eat home-cooked 
meals in every country he possibly can. 

Edmund Backhouse is the nom de guerre of a 
Beijing-based    writer  and   translator.  Despite 
his  potty  mouth  and his  choice  of  namesake, 
he leads a relatively virtuous life.

          is  a  much  prettier  name  than  “Half- 
Half,”  natch.         means  “Mandarin  ducks,” 
a traditional  Chinese  symbol  of  marital  fidel- 
ity.  Mandarin  duck  hotpot  has  a wavy  divide 
going  down the  middle,  so it looks  either like 
an incomplete “Yin-Yang,” or Mandarin ducks 
locked in a 69 position.
