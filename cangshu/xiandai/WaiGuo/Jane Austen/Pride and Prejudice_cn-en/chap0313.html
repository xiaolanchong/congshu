<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and
alone.  His friend had left him that morning for London, but
was to return home in ten days time.  He sat with them above an
hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.  Mrs. Bennet invited
him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern,
he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这次拜访以后，没有过几天，彬格莱先生又来<BR>
了，而且只有他一个人来。他的朋友已经在当<BR>
天早上动身上伦敦去，不过十天以内就要回来<BR>

。班纳特太太留他吃饭，他一再道歉，说是别<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more

she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of
waiting on them.

<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“明天能来吗？”<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">能来，他明天没有约会；于是他爽爽快快地接<BR>
受了她的邀请。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none
of them dressed.  In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in
her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">第二天他果然来了，来得非常早，太太小姐们<BR>
都还没有打扮好。班纳特太太身穿晨衣，头发<BR>
才梳好一半，连忙跑进女儿房间里去大声嚷道<BR>
：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.  He is come --
Mr. Bingley is come. -- He is, indeed.  Make haste, make haste.
Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on
with her gown.  Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“亲爱的吉英，快些下楼去。他来了。彬格莱<BR>
先生来了。他真来了。赶快，赶快。我说，莎<BR>
蕾，赶快上大小姐这儿来，帮她穿衣服。你别<BR>
去管丽萃小姐的头发啦。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say
Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs
half an hour ago."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英说：“我们马上就下去，也许吉蒂比我们<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Oh!  hang Kitty!  what has she to do with it?  Come be quick,

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“哦，别去管吉蒂吧！关她什么事？快些，快<BR>
些！好孩子，你的腰带在哪儿？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to
go down without one of her sisters.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">母亲走了以后，吉英再三要一个妹妹陪着她下<BR>
楼去。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again
in the evening.  After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library,
as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet
sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a
considerable time, without making any impression on them.
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did,
she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma?  What do
you keep winking at me for?  What am I to do?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">到了下午，显见得班纳特太太又一心要成全他<BR>
们两人在一起。喝过了茶，班纳特先生照着他<BR>
平常的习惯，到书房里去了，曼丽上楼弹琴去<BR>
了。班太太看见五个障碍去了两个，便立刻对<BR>
伊丽莎白和咖苔琳挤眉弄眼，吉蒂终于很天真<BR>
地说：“怎么啦，妈妈？你为什么老是对我眨<BR>
眼？你要我做什么呀？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Nothing child, nothing.  I did not wink at you."  She then sat
still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious
occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here,
my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her
distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that <I>she</I>
would not give in to it.  In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet
half-opened the door and called out,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“没什么，孩子，没什么。我没有对你眨眼。<BR>
”于是她又多坐了五分钟，实在不愿意再错过<BR>
这大好的机会，她便突然站起来，对吉蒂说：<BR>
“来，宝贝，我跟你说句话，”说过这话，她<BR>
便把吉蒂拉了出去。吉英立刻对伊丽莎白望了<BR>
一眼，意思说，她受不住这样的摆布，请求伊<BR>
丽莎白不要也这样做。一眨眼工夫，只见班纳<BR>
特太太打开了半边门，喊道：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“丽萃，亲爱的，我要跟你说句话。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth was forced to go.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白只得走出去。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her
mother, as soon as she was in the hall.  "Kitty and I are going
up stairs to sit in my dressing room."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">一走进穿堂，她母亲就对她说：“我们最好不<BR>
要去打扰他们，吉蒂和我都上楼到我化妆室里<BR>
去了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but
remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of
sight, then returned into the drawing room.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白没有跟她争辩，静静地留在穿堂里，<BR>
等母亲和吉蒂走得看不见了，才又回到会客室<BR>
来。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.  Bingley
was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover
of her daughter.  His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a
most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore
with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all
her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance
particularly grateful to the daughter.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太这一天的打算没有如愿。彬格莱样<BR>
样都讨人喜爱，只可惜没有公然以她女儿的情<BR>
人自居。他安然自若，神情愉快，在她们晚间<BR>
的家庭聚会上，人人都喜欢他。虽然班纳特太<BR>
太不知分寸，多管闲事，他却竭力忍受；尽管<BR>
她讲出多少蠢话，他也一些不动声色，很有耐<BR>
性地听着，这特别叫那女儿满意。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he
went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own
and Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot
with her husband.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他几乎用不到主人家邀请，便自己留下来吃饭<BR>
；他还没有告辞，便又顺应着班纳特太太的意<BR>
思，将计就计，约定明天来跟她丈夫打鸟。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but
Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must
speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the
stated time.  Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded
that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">自从这一天以后，吉英再也不说对他无所谓了<BR>
。姐妹两人事后一句也没有谈起彬格莱，可是<BR>
伊丽莎白上床的时候，心里很是快活，觉得只<BR>
要达西先生不准时赶回来，这件事很快便会有<BR>
眉目。不过她又认为事到如今，达西先生一定<BR>
早已表示同意。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet
spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.  The latter
was much more agreeable than his companion expected.  There was
nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke
his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more
communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen
him.  Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the
evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get every
body away from him and her daughter.  Elizabeth, who had a
letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose
soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to
cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's
schemes.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">第二天彬格莱准时赴约，依照事先约定，跟班<BR>
纳特先生在一起消磨了整个上午。班纳特先生<BR>
和蔼可亲，实在远远出乎彬格莱先生的意料。<BR>
这是因为，彬格莱没有什么傲慢或愚蠢的地方<BR>
惹他嘲笑，或是叫他讨厌得不肯理睬他。比起<BR>
彬格莱上次跟他见面的情形来，他这次更加健<BR>
谈。也不象以前那样古怪。不用说，彬格莱跟<BR>
他一同回来吃了中饭，晚上班纳特太太又设法<BR>
把别人都遗开，让他跟她女儿在一起。伊丽莎<BR>
白今晚有一封信要写吃过茶以后，便到起坐间<BR>
去写信，因为她看到别人都坐下打牌，不便再<BR>
和她母亲作对。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was
finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was
reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for
her.  On opening the door, she perceived her sister and
Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the
faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away
from each other, would have told it all.  <I>Their</I> situation
was awkward enough; but <I>her's</I> she thought was still worse.
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on
the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as
the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">等她写好了信回到客厅里来的时候，一看那种<BR>
情景，不由得触目惊心，认为母亲果然比她聪<BR>
明得多。且说她一走进门，只见姐姐和彬格莱<BR>
一起站在壁炉跟前，看来正在谈话谈得起劲，<BR>
如果这情形还没有什么可疑，那么，只消看看<BR>
他们俩那般的脸色，那般慌慌张张转过身去，<BR>
立即分开，你心里便有数了。他们窘态毕露，<BR>
可是她自己却更窘。他们坐了下来，一言不发<BR>
；伊丽莎白正待走开，只见彬格莱突然站起身<BR>
来，跟她姐姐悄悄地说了几句话，便跑出去了<BR>
。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence
would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,
with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature
in the world.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英心里有了快活的事情，向来不隐瞒伊丽莎<BR>
白，于是她马上抱住妹妹，极其热情地承认她<BR>
自己是天下最幸福的人。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much.  I do not
deserve it.  Oh!  why is not every body as happy?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她又说：“太幸福了！实在太幸福了。我不配<BR>
。哎哟，为什么不能人人都象我这样幸福呢？<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a
warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.  Every
sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say
half that remained to be said for the present.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白连忙向她道喜，真诚热烈，欢欣异常<BR>
，实在非笔墨所能形容。她每说一句亲切的话<BR>
，就增加吉英一分幸福的感觉。可是吉英不能<BR>
跟妹妹多纠缠了，她要说的话还没有说到一半<BR>
，可不能再说下去了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.  "I would not on
any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow
her to hear it from any one but myself.  He is gone to my
father already.  Oh!  Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate
will give such pleasure to all my dear family!  how shall I
bear so much happiness!"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英说：“我得马上上妈妈那儿去，我千万不<BR>
能辜负她一片好心好意，我要亲自去把这件事<BR>
说给她听，不要别人转言。他已经去告诉爸爸<BR>
了。噢，丽萃，你知道，家里听到这这件事，<BR>
一个个会觉得多么高兴啊！我怎么受得了这样<BR>
的幸福！”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken
up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">于是她连忙到母亲那儿去，只见母亲已经特地<BR>
散了牌场，跟吉蒂坐在椅上。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity
and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had
given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白一个人留在那儿，心想；家里人为了<BR>
这件事，几个月来一直在烦神担心，如今却一<BR>
下子便得到了解决，她想到这里，不禁一笑。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection!  of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!
the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她说：“这就是他那位朋友处心积虑的结局！<BR>
是他自己的姐妹自欺欺人的下场！这个结果真<BR>
是太幸福、太圆满、太有意思了！”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference
with her father had been short and to the purpose.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">没过几分钟，彬格莱就到她这儿来了，因为他<BR>
跟她父亲谈得很简捷扼要。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他一打开门，便连忙问道：“你姐姐在哪儿？<BR>
”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"With my mother up stairs.  She will be down in a moment,
I dare say."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“在楼上我妈那儿，马上就会下来。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good
wishes and affection of a sister.  Elizabeth honestly and
heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their
relationship.  They shook hands with great cordiality; and
then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he
had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed
all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded,
because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and
super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity
of feeling and taste between her and himself.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他于是关上了门，走到她跟前，让她亲切地祝<BR>
贺姐夫。伊丽莎白真心诚意地说，她为他们俩<BR>
未来的美满姻缘感到欣喜。两人亲切地握了握<BR>
手。她只听得他讲他自己的幸福，讲吉英的十<BR>
全十美，一直讲到吉英下楼为止。虽然这些话<BR>
是出于一个情人之口，可是她深信他那幸福的<BR>
愿望一定可以实现，因为吉英绝顶聪明，脾气<BR>
更是好得不能再好，这便是幸福的基础，而且<BR>
他们彼此的性格和趣味也十分相近。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the
satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet
animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.
Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation
in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked
to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr.
Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly
showed how really happy he was.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这一晚大家都非常高兴，班纳特小姐因为心里<BR>
得意，脸上也显得鲜艳娇美，光彩焕发，比平<BR>
常更加漂亮。吉蒂笑笑忍忍，忍忍笑笑，一心<BR>
只希望这样的幸运赶快轮到自己头上。班纳特<BR>
太太同彬格莱足足谈了半个钟头之久，她满口<BR>
嘉许，极端赞美可总觉得不能够把满腔的热情<BR>
充分表达出来；班纳特先生跟大家一块儿吃晚<BR>
饭的时候，但看他的谈吐举止，便可以看出他<BR>
也快活到极点。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till
their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he
was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">不过他当时对这件事却一字不提，等到贵客一<BR>
走，他又连忙转过身来对大女儿说：<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Jane, I congratulate you.  You will be a very happy woman."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“吉英，我恭喜你。你可成了一个极幸福的姑<BR>

goodness.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英立刻走上前去吻他，多谢他的好意。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure
in thinking you will be so happily settled.  I have not a doubt
of your doing very well together.  Your tempers are by no means
unlike.  You are each of you so complying, that nothing will
ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat
you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他说：“你是个好孩子；想到你这样幸福地解<BR>
决了终身大事，我真高兴。我相信你们一定能<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Exceed their income!  My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife,
"what are you talking of?  Why, he has four or five thousand a
year, and very likely more."  Then addressing her daughter,
"Oh!  my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!  I am sure I shan't
get a wink of sleep all night.  I knew how it would be.  I
always said it must be so, at last.  I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing!  I remember, as soon as ever I saw
him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought
how likely it was that you should come together.  Oh!  he is
the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他的太太叫道：“入不敷出！我的好老爷，你<BR>
这是什么话？他每年有四五千镑收入，可能还<BR>

吉英，我太高兴了！我今天晚上休想睡得着觉<BR>

himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and
