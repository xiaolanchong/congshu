<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation
that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear
sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was
pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet
was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by

Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">转眼之间，他和丽迪雅的行期来到了，班纳特<BR>

things.

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It is no such thing.  Lydia does not leave me because she is

so far off.  If that had been nearer, she would not have gone
so soon."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“完全不是那么回事。丽迪雅并不是因为结了<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into
was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the
agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be
in circulation.  The housekeeper at Netherfield had received
orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming
down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.
Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.  She looked at Jane, and
smiled and shook her head by turns.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">且说这事虽然使班纳特太太精神颓丧，不过没<BR>

闻尼日斐花园的主人一两天内就要回到乡下来<BR>
，打几个星期的猎，他的管家奶奶正在奉命收<BR>
拾一切。班纳特太太听到这消息，简直坐立不<BR>
安。她一会儿望望吉英，一会儿笑笑，一会儿<BR>
摇摇头。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,"
(for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news).  "Well, so
much the better.  Not that I care about it, though.  He is
nothing to us, you know, and I am sure <I>I</I> never want to
see him again.  But, however, he is very welcome to come to
Netherfield, if he likes it.  And who knows what <I>may</I>
happen?  But that is nothing to us.  You know, sister, we
agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.  And so,
is it quite certain he is coming?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“好极了，彬格莱先生居然要来了，妹妹”（<BR>

尼日斐花园来，我们自然还是欢迎他。谁知道<BR>

，我们早就讲好，再也不提这件事。他真的会<BR>
来吗？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls
was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out
myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that
it was certain true.  He comes down on Thursday at the latest,
very likely on Wednesday.  She was going to the butcher's, she
told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she
has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她的妹妹说：“你放心好了，尼可斯奶奶昨儿<BR>
晚上去过麦里屯。我亲眼看见她走过，便特地<BR>
跑出去向她打听，是不是真有这回事；她告诉<BR>
我说，的确真有这回事。他最迟星期四就会来<BR>
，很可能星期三就来。她又说，她正要上肉铺<BR>
子去定点儿肉，准备星期三做菜，她还有六只<BR>
鸭子，已经可以宰了吃。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without
changing colour.  It was many months since she had mentioned
his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone
together, she said,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特小姐听到他要来，不禁变了脸色。她已<BR>
经有好几个月没有在伊丽莎白面前提起过他的<BR>
名字；可是这一次等到只有她们姐妹两人在一<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of
the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.  But
don't imagine it was from any silly cause.  I was only confused
for the moment, because I felt that I <I>should</I> be looked at.
I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with
pleasure or pain.  I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone;
because we shall see the less of him.  Not that I am afraid of
<I>myself</I>, but I dread other people's remarks."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“丽萃，今天姨母告诉我这个消息的时候，我<BR>
看到你直望着我，我知道我当时神色很难看；<BR>
可是人千万别以为是为了这一类的傻事，只不<BR>
过当时我觉得大家都在盯着我看所以一时之间<BR>
有些心乱。老实告诉你，这个消息既不使我感<BR>
到愉快，也不使我感到痛苦。只有一点使我感<BR>
到高兴──这次他是一个人来的，因此我们看<BR>
到他的机会就会比较少。我本身并没有什么顾<BR>
虑，而是怕别人闲言闲语。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.  Had she not seen
him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of
coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but
she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to
the greater probability of his coming there <I>with</I> his friend's
permission, or being bold enough to come without it.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白对这件事不知道怎么想才好。如果她<BR>
上次没有在德比郡见到他，她也许会以为他此<BR>
来并非别有用心。可是她依旧认为他对吉英未<BR>
能忘情。这次他究竟是得到了他朋友的允许才<BR>
来的呢，还是他自己大胆跑来的？这实在叫她<BR>
无从断定。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man
cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without
raising all this speculation!  I <I>will</I> leave him to himself."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她有时候不由得这么想：“这可怜的人，回到<BR>
自己租定的房子里来，却引起人家这样的纷纷<BR>
猜测，想起来着实令人难受。我也别去管他吧<BR>
。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be
her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could
easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.  They
were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen
them.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">不管她姐姐嘴上怎么说，心里怎么想，是否盼<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their
parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward
again.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">大约在一年以前，父母曾经热烈地争论过这个<BR>

她丈夫说：<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet,
"you will wait on him of course."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"No, no.  You forced me into visiting him last year, and
promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my
daughters.  But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on
a fool's errand again."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“不去，不去，去年你硬逼着我去看他，说什<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an
attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his
returning to Netherfield.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他太太又说，那位贵人一回到尼日斐花园，邻<BR>
居们都少不了要去拜候他。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he.  "If he wants our
society, let him seek it.  He knows where we live.  I will not
spend <I>my</I> hours in running after my neighbours every time they
go away and come back again."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他说：“我恨透了这一类的礼节，要是他想跟<BR>
我们来往，让他自己找上门来好了。他又不是<BR>
不知道我们的住址。邻居们每次来来去去，都<BR>
得要我来迎送，我可没有这种功夫。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do
not wait on him.  But, however, that shan't prevent my asking
him to dine here, I am determined.  We must have Mrs. Long and
the Gouldings soon.  That will make thirteen with ourselves, so
there will be just room at table for him."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“唔，你不去拜访他，那就是太不知礼。不过<BR>
，我还是可以请他到这儿来吃饭，我已经决定<BR>
要请他来。我们本当早些请郎格太太和戈丁一<BR>
家人来，加上我们自己家里的人，一共是十三<BR>
个，所以正好留个位子给他。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear
her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know
that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence
of it, before <I>they</I> did.  As the day of his arrival drew near,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她决定了这么做，心里就觉得快慰了些，因此<BR>
丈夫的无理也就叫她好受了些；然而，这样一<BR>
来，结果就会使邻居们比他们先看到彬格莱先<BR>
生。他来的日子迫近了。吉英对她妹妹说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her
sister.  "It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect
indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually
talked of.  My mother means well; but she does not know, no one
can know, how much I suffer from what she says.  Happy shall I
be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我现在反而觉得他还是不要来的好，其实也<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied
Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power.  You must feel
it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a
sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白说：“我真想说几句话安慰安慰你，<BR>
可惜一句也说不出。你一定明白我的意思。我<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Bingley arrived.  Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of
servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that
the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as
long as it could.  She counted the days that must intervene
before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him
before.  But on the third morning after his arrival in
Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock and ride towards the house.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">彬格莱先生终于来了。班纳特太太多亏了佣人<BR>
们加以协助，获得消息最早，因此烦神也烦得<BR>

便屈指计算着日子，看看还得再隔多少天才能<BR>
送请贴。幸亏他来到哈福德郡的第三天，班纳<BR>
特太太便从化妆室的窗口看见他骑着马走进围<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.  Jane
resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to
satisfy her mother, went to the window -- she looked, -- she
saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她喜出望外，急急忙忙唤女儿们来分享她这种<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.  She knew
but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt
for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him
almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory
letter.  Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.  Each felt for
the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother
talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to
be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being
heard by either of them.  But Elizabeth had sources of
uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she
had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to
relate her own change of sentiment towards him.  To Jane, he
could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose
merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person to whom the whole family were
indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded
herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as
reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley.  Her
astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield, to
Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal
to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour
in Derbyshire.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">吉英极其惊奇、极其关心地望着伊丽莎白。她<BR>
完全不知道妹妹在德比郡跟达西会面的事，因<BR>
此觉得妹妹自从收到他那封解释的信以后，这<BR>
回第一次跟他见面，一定会觉得很窘。姐妹俩<BR>
都不十分好受。她们彼此体贴，各有隐衷。母<BR>
亲依旧在唠叨不休，说她颇不喜欢达西先生，<BR>
只因为看他究竟还是彬格莱先生的朋友，所以<BR>
才客客气气地接待他一番。这些话姐妹俩都没<BR>
有听见。其实伊丽莎白心神不安，的确还另有<BR>
原因，这是吉英所不知道的。伊丽莎白始终没<BR>
有勇气把嘉丁纳太太那封信拿给吉英看，也没<BR>
有勇气向吉英叙述她对他感情变化的经过。吉<BR>
英只知道他向她求婚，被她拒绝过，她还低估<BR>
过他的长处，殊不知伊丽莎白的隐衷绝不仅如<BR>
此而已，她认为他对她们全家都有莫大的恩典<BR>
，她因此对他另眼看待。她对他的情意即使抵<BR>
不上吉英对彬格莱那样深切，至少也象吉英对<BR>
待彬格莱一样地合情合理，恰到好处。达西这<BR>
次回到尼日斐花园，并且自动到浪搏恩来重新<BR>
找她，确实使她感到惊奇，几乎象她上次在德<BR>
比郡见他作风大变时一样地感到惊奇。<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for
half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight
added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time
that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.  But she
would not be secure.

daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them
to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the
door.  Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate
than Elizabeth had expected.  On the gentlemen's appearing, her
colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease,
and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom

sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not
often command.  She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.  He
looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at
Pemberley.  But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence
be what he was before her uncle and aunt.  It was a painful,
but not an improbable, conjecture.

the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address
to his friend.

question which she could not answer without confusion, said
scarcely any thing.  He was not seated by her; perhaps that was
the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in
Derbyshire.  There he had talked to her friends, when he could
not to herself.  But now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his
face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and
frequently on no object but the ground.  More thoughtfulness
and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were
plainly expressed.  She was disappointed, and angry with
herself for being so.

I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it
in the papers.  It was in the <I>Times</I> and the <I>Courier</I>, I
know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.  It was only
said, ``Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,''

Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from
observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the
admiration of her former lover.  When first he came in, he had
spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be
giving her more of his attention.  He found her as handsome as
she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected,
though not quite so chatty.  Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really
persuaded that she talked as much as ever.  But her mind was
so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was
silent.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">不过话说回来，虽然终身幸福也抵偿不了眼前<BR>
