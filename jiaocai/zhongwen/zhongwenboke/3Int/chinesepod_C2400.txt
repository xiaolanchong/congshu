A:

唉，还有两个礼拜，我们小宝就要上小学了，到时候谁去接送啊？

ài, háiyǒu liǎng gè lǐbài, wǒmen XiǎoBǎo jiùyào shàng xiǎoxué le, dàoshíhou shéi qù jiē sòng ā?

Hey, we've got two weeks. Our child is about to start elementary school. When that time comes, who's going to take him to and from school?

B:

让他自己走路去吧，学校又不远，他认识路。男孩子要早点独立，我小学的时候都是自己去的。

ràng tā zìjǐ zǒulù qù ba, xuéxiào yòu bù yuǎn, tā rènshi lù. nánháizi yào zǎodiǎn dúlì, wǒ xiǎoxué deshíhou dōu shì zìjǐ qù de.

Let him walk by himself. The school isn't far and he knows the way. Boys need to be independent early. When I was in elementary school, I went by myself.

A:

可是他才刚上小学一年级。再说了，以前能和现在比吗，以前马路上哪有这么多车啊？开学前学校开过一次家长会，老师说了：为了安全，一年级到三年级的学生上学放学一定要有家长接送。

kěshì tā cái gāng shàng xiǎoxué yīniánjí. zàishuō le, yǐqián néng hé xiànzài bǐ ma, yǐqián mǎlù shang nǎ yǒu zhème duō chē ā? kāixué qián xuéxiào kāi guo yī cì jiāzhǎnghuì, lǎoshī shuō le： wèile ānquán, yīniánjí dào sānniánjí de xuéshēng shàngxué fàngxué yīdìng yào yǒu jiāzhǎng jiē sòng.

But he's just started the first grade. In addition, can you compare the way things were to how they are now? Were there so many cars on the roads before? Before school started, the school held a parents meeting and the teacher said: In order to be safe, students from first to third grade going to and from school must have a parent pick them up and drop them off.

B:

那几点要到学校？几点放学？

nà jǐdiǎn yào dào xuéxiào? jǐdiǎn fàngxué?

Then what time do we need to get to school? When does school end?

A:

老师说七点半之前要到校。四点左右放学。

lǎoshī shuō qīdiǎnbàn zhīqián yào dào xiào. sìdiǎn zuǒyòu fàngxué.

The teacher said that we need to be at school before 7:30. School gets out around 4.

B:

放学我让我妈去接他。我平时早上都是八点出门的。你能送他吗？

fàngxué wǒ ràng wǒ mā qù jiē tā. wǒ píngshí zǎoshang dōu shì bādiǎn chūmén de. nǐ néng sòng tā ma?

Getting out of school, I'll get my mom to go pick him up. Most mornings I leave the house at 8. Can you drop him off?

A:

可是，如果我送他，他七点就得到学校。他才七岁，早上要让他多睡睡。

kěshì, rúguǒ wǒ sòng tā, tā qīdiǎn jiù děi dào xuéxiào. tā cái qī suì, zǎoshang yào ràng tā duō shuì shuì.

But, if I take him, he'll get to school at 7. He's only 7 years old. We should let him sleep more in the morning.

B:

那只能我送了，我一起床就送他，回来再吃早饭。

nà zhǐ néng wǒ sòng le, wǒ yī qǐchuáng jiù sòng tā, huílái zài chī zǎofàn.

Then only I can drop him off. I'll take him as soon as I get up, then come back and eat breakfast.

A:

不行，以后你也得跟我们一起早起，给孩子做个好榜样！

bù xíng, yǐhòu nǐ yě děi gēn wǒmen yīqǐ zǎoqǐ, gěi háizi zuò gè hǎo bǎngyàng!

No way. In the future, you also should get up early with us and set a good example!
