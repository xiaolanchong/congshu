Intermediate - The Snail Maiden

(C1935)

从前，有一位单身汉。他非常勤劳，每天都去地里干活。

cóngqián, yǒu yī wèi dānshēnhàn. tā fēicháng qínláo, měitiān dōu qù dì lǐ gànhuó.

Once upon a time there was a bachelor. He was very industrious. Every day he went out to work in the fields.

有一次，他看到一只大田螺，就带回家，养在水缸里。

yǒuyīcì, tā kàndào yī zhī dà tiánluó, jiù dài huí jiā, yǎng zài shuǐgāng lǐ.

Once he found a large snail. He took it home and raised it in a jar of water.

很快，三年过去了。有一天，他干完活回家，发现桌子上摆满了饭菜。

hěnkuài, sān nián guòqù le. yǒu yī tiān, tā gàn wán huó huíjiā, fāxiàn zhuōzi shàng bǎi mǎn le fàncài.

Very soon, three years went by. One day when he returned home from work, the bachelor discovered his table full of prepared food.

连续几天都是这样。他感到很奇怪，就躲起来看是谁做的。

liánxù jǐtiān dōu shì zhèyàng. tā gǎndào hěn qíguài, jiù duǒ qǐlái kàn shì shéi zuò de.

This continued to happen the next few days. He found it very strange, so he hid to find out who was making it.

等啊等，快到中午的时候，从水缸里走出一位漂亮姑娘，她很快就做好了饭。

děng a děng, kuài dào zhōngwǔ de shíhou, cóng shuǐgāng lǐ zǒuchū yī wèi piàoliang gūniang, tā hěnkuài jiù zuò hǎo le fàn.

He waited and waited. When it was almost noon, a beautiful woman came out of the jar of water. In no time at all she'd prepared all the food.

单身汉问姑娘为什么要帮他做饭。

dānshēnhàn wèn gūniang wèishénme yào bāng tā zuòfàn.

The bachelor asked the woman why she was making the food for him.

原来姑娘就是田螺变的，为了报答他。

yuánlái gūniang jiùshì tiánluó biàn de, wèile bàodá tā.

The woman had been the snail all along. She was making the food to repay him.

后来他们结婚了，过着幸福的生活。

hòulái tāmen jiéhūn le, guò zhe xìngfú de shēnghuó.

After that the two of them got married and lived happily ever after.
