Elementary - I Can See Clearly Now (B0020)  A:    Hello, Arthur. What seems to be the problem?  B:    Hey doc.     Well, I think I might need glasses.          I’m        getting  headaches,       and  I  really  struggle  to  see        things  that  are  far  away.    But  I  have  always  had        20/20 vision.  A:    Sounds  like  you  may  be  far-sighted.         OK,  then,        cover your left eye and read the chart in front of        you.  B:    Mmm. . .    X, E, R, 3, a question mark, and I can’t        quite make out the other symbol but I think it’s the        peace sign.  A:    Wow, Arthur! You’re as blind as a bat!  B:    Yeah, I know, my vision is really blurry at times.  A:    Ok then, head on over to the other room and pick        out some frames while I ﬁll out your prescription.  B:    Thanks doc!  A:    Arthur, that’s the bathroom.  Key Vocabulary  seem to be                        Phrase                appears or is  struggle                           Verb                 try very hard  20/20 vision                      Phrase                perfect eyesight  make out                           Verb                 see  far sighted                       Phrase                see   far-away    things                                                          more     clearly    than                                                          things nearby  as blind as a bat                 Phrase                have really poor vision  vision                            Noun    (sin-         ability to see things                                    gular)
