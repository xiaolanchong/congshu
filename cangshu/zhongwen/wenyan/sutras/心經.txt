唐 三藏法師玄奘 譯
The Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra

觀自在菩薩，行深般若波羅蜜多時，照見五蘊皆空，度一切苦厄。
WHEN THE BODHISATTVA AVALOKITESVARA, WAS COURSING IN THE DEEP PRAJNA PARAMITA, HE PERCEIVED THAT ALL FIVE SKANDHAS ARE EMPTY, THUS HE OVERCAME ALL ILLS AND SUFFERING.

舍利子！色不異空，空不異色；色即是空，空即是色，受想行識亦復如是。
O, SARIPUTRA, FORM DOES NOT DIFFER FROM VOIDNESS, AND VOIDNESS DOES NOT DIFFER  FROM FORM. FORM IS VOIDNESS AND VOIDNESS IS FORM; THE SAME IS TURE FOR FEELING, CONCEPTION,VOLITION AND CONSCIOUSNESS.

舍利子！是諸法空相，不生不滅，不垢不淨，不增不減。
SARIPUTRA, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VOIDNESS OF ALL DHARMAS ARE NON-ARISING, NON-CEASING, NON-DEFILED, NON-PURE, NON-INCREASING, NON-DECREASING.

是故，空中無色，無受想行識；無眼耳鼻舌身意；無色聲香味觸法；
THEREFORE , IN THE VOID THERE IS NO FORM, FEELING, CONCEPTION, VOLITION OR CONSCIOUSNESS; NO EYE, EAR, NOSE, TONGUE, BODY OR MIND; NO FORM, SOUND, SMELL, TASTE, TOUCH, MIND-OBJECT, OR EYE REALM, UNTIL WE COME TO NO REALM OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

無眼界，乃至無意識界；無無明，亦無無明盡，乃至無老死，亦無老死盡；
NO IGNORANCE AND ALSO NO ENDING OF IGNORANCE, UNTIL WE COME TO NO OLD AGE AND DEATH, AND NO ENDING OF OLD AGE AND DEATH. ALSO, THERE IS NO TRUTH OF SUFFERING, OF THE CAUSE OF SUFFERING, OF THE CESSATION OF SUFFERING, NOR OF THE PATH.

無苦集滅道；無智亦無得。以無所得故，菩提薩埵。
THERE IS NO WISDOM, AND THERE IS NO ATTAINMENT WHATSOEVER. BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING TO BE ATTAINED, THE BODHISATTVA , RELYING ON PRAJNA PARAMITA, HAS NO OBSTRUCTION IN HIS MIND. BECAUSE THERE IS NO OBSTRUCTION, HE HAS NO FEAR. AND, THUS, HE PASSES FAR BEYOND CONFUSED IMAGINATION AND REACHES ULTIMATE NIRVANA.

依般若波羅蜜多故，心無罣礙；無罣礙故，無有恐怖，遠離顛倒夢想，究竟涅槃。
THERE IS NO WISDOM, AND THERE IS NO ATTAINMENT WHATSOEVER. BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING TO BE ATTAINED, THE BODHISATTVA , RELYING ON PRAJNA PARAMITA, HAS NO OBSTRUCTION IN HIS MIND. BECAUSE THERE IS NO OBSTRUCTION, HE HAS NO FEAR. AND, THUS, HE PASSES FAR BEYOND CONFUSED IMAGINATION AND REACHES ULTIMATE NIRVANA.

三世諸佛，依般若波羅蜜多故，得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。
THE BUDDHAS OF THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE,ALSO RELYING ON THE PRAJNA PARAMITA, HAVE ATTAINED SUPREME ENLIGHTENMENT.

故知：般若波羅蜜多是大神咒，是大明咒，是無上咒，是無等等咒，能除一切苦，真實不虛。
THEREFORE, THE PRAJNA PARAMITA IS THE GREAT MAGIC SPELL, THE GREAT SPELL OF ILLUMINATION, THE UTMOST SPELL, THE SUPREME SPELL, WHICH CAN TRULY PROTECT ONE FROM ALL SUFFERING WITHOUT FAIL.

故說般若波羅蜜多咒，即說咒曰：揭諦揭諦，波羅揭諦，波羅僧揭諦，菩提薩婆訶。
HENCE, HE UTTERED THE SPELL OF PRAJNA PARAMITA, SAYING,  “GATE, GATE, PARAGATE, PARASAMGATE, BODHI, SVAHA!”
