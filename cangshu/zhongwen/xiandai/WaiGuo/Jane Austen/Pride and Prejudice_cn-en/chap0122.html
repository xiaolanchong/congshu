<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again
during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to
listen to Mr. Collins.  Elizabeth took an opportunity of
thanking her.  "It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I
am more obliged to you than I can express."  Charlotte assured
her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it
amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.  This
was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther
than Elizabeth had any conception of; -- its object was nothing
less than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's
addresses, by engaging them towards herself.  Such was Miss
Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when
they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of
success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the
next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge
to throw himself at her feet.  He was anxious to avoid the
notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him
depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he
was not willing to have the attempt known till its success
could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and
with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he
was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.  Miss
Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards
the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in
the lane.  But little had she dared to hope that so much love
and eloquence awaited her there.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这一天班纳特全家都被卢卡斯府上请去吃饭，<BR>
又多蒙卢卡斯小姐一片好意，整日陪着柯林斯<BR>
先生谈话。伊丽莎白利用了一个机会向她道谢<BR>
。她说：“这样可以叫他精神痛快些，我对你<BR>
真是说不尽的感激。”夏绿蒂说，能够替朋友<BR>
效劳，非常乐意，虽然花了一点时间，却得到<BR>
了很大的快慰。这真是太好了；可是夏绿蒂的<BR>
好意，远非伊丽莎白所能意料；原来夏绿蒂是<BR>
有意要尽量逗引柯林斯先生跟她自己谈话，免<BR>
得他再去向伊丽莎白献殷勤。她这个计谋看来<BR>
进行得十分顺利。晚上大家分手的时候，夏绿<BR>
蒂几乎满有把握地感觉到，要不是柯林斯先生<BR>
这么快就要离开哈福德郡，事情一定能成功。<BR>
但是她这样的想法，未免太不了解他那如火如<BR>
荼、独断独行的性格。且说第二天一大早，柯<BR>
林斯就采用了相当狡猾的办法，溜出了浪博恩<BR>
，赶到卢家庄来向她屈身求爱。他唯恐给表妹<BR>
们碰到了，他认为，假若让她们看见他走开，<BR>
那就必定会让她们猜中他的打算，而他不等到<BR>
事情有了成功的把握，决不愿意让人家知道。<BR>
虽说他当场看到夏绿蒂对他颇有情意，因此觉<BR>
得这事十拿九稳可以成功，可是从星期三那场<BR>
冒险以来，他究竟不敢太鲁莽了。不过人家倒<BR>
很巴结地接待了他。卢卡斯小姐从楼上窗口看<BR>
见他向她家里走来，便连忙到那条小道上去接<BR>
他，又装出是偶然相逢的样子。她万万想不到<BR>
，柯林斯这一次竟然约她带来了说不尽的千情<BR>
万爱。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,
every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of
both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her
to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and
though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the
lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.  The
stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his
courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the
pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not
how soon that establishment were gained.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">在短短的一段时间里，柯林斯先生说了多多少<BR>
少的话，于是两人之间便一切都讲妥了，而且<BR>
双方都很满意。一走进屋子，他就诚恳地要求<BR>
她择定吉日，使他成为世界上最幸福的人，虽<BR>
说这种请求，暂应该置之不理，可是这位小姐<BR>
并不想要拿他的幸福当儿戏。他天生一副蠢相<BR>
，求起爱来总是打动不了女人的心，女人一碰<BR>
到他求爱，总是请他碰壁。卢卡斯小姐所以愿<BR>
意答应他，完全是为了财产打算，至于那笔财<BR>
产何年何月可以拿到手，她倒不在乎。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their
consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.
Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible
match for their daughter, to whom they could give little
fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly
fair.  Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many
years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William
gave it as his decided opinion that whenever Mr. Collins should
be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly
expedient that both he and his wife should make their
appearance at St. James's.  The whole family, in short, were
properly overjoyed on the occasion.  The younger girls formed
hopes of <I>coming</I> <I>out</I> a year or two sooner than they might
otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their
apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.  Charlotte
herself was tolerably composed.  She had gained her point, and
had time to consider of it.  Her reflections were in general
satisfactory.  Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her
must be imaginary.  But still he would be her husband. --
Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage
had always been her object; it was the only honourable
provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and
however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.  This preservative she had
now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having
ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.  The
least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise
it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she
valued beyond that of any other person.  Elizabeth would
wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution
was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation.  She resolved to give her the information
herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to
Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before
any of the family.  A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty;
for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in
such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising
great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous
love.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他们俩立刻就去请求威廉爵士夫妇加以允许，<BR>
老夫妇连忙高高兴兴地答应了。他们本来没有<BR>
什么嫁妆给女儿，论柯林斯先生目前的境况，<BR>
真是再适合不过的一个女婿，何况他将来一定<BR>
会发一笔大财。卢卡斯太太立刻带着空前未有<BR>
过的兴趣，开始盘算着班纳特先生还有多少年<BR>
可活；威廉爵士一口断定说，只要林斯先生一<BR>
旦得到了浪博恩的财产，他夫妇俩就大有觐见<BR>
皇上的希望了。总而言之，这件大事叫全家人<BR>
都快活透顶。几位小女儿都满怀希望，认为这<BR>
一来可以早一两年出去交际了，男孩子们再也<BR>
不担心夏绿蒂会当老处女了。只有夏绿蒂本人<BR>
倒相当镇定。她现在初步已经成功，还有时间<BR>
去仔细考虑一番。她想了一下，大致满意。柯<BR>
林斯先生固然既不通情达理，又不讨人喜爱，<BR>
同他相处实在是件讨厌的事，他对她的爱也一<BR>
定是空中楼阁，不过她还是要他做丈夫。虽然<BR>
她对于婚姻和夫妇生活，估价都不甚高，可是<BR>
，结婚到底是她一贯的目标，大凡家境不好而<BR>
又爱过相当教育的青年女子，总是把结婚当作<BR>
仅有的一条体面的退路。尽管结婚并不一定会<BR>
叫人幸福，但总算约她自己安排了一个最可靠<BR>
的储藏室日后可以不致挨冻受饥。她现在就获<BR>
得这样一个储藏室了。她今年二十七岁，人长<BR>
得又不标致，这个储藏室当然会使她觉得无限<BR>
幸运。只有一件事令人不快──那就是说，伊<BR>
丽莎白・班纳特准会对这门亲事感到惊奇，而<BR>
她又是一向把伊丽莎白的交情看得比什么人的<BR>
交情都重要。伊丽莎白一定会诧异，说不定还<BR>
要埋怨她。虽说她一经下定决心便不会动摇，<BR>
然而人家非难起来一定会使她难受。于是她决<BR>
定亲自把这件事告诉她，嘱咐柯林斯先生回到<BR>
浪博恩吃饭的时候，不要在班纳特家里任何人<BR>
面前透露一点风声。对方当然唯命是从，答应<BR>
保守秘密，其实秘密是很难保守，因为他出去<BR>
得太久了，一定会引起人家的好奇心，因此他<BR>
一回去，大家立刻向他问长问短，他得要有几<BR>
分能耐才能够遮掩过去，加上他又把不得把此<BR>
番情场得意的情况宣扬出去，因此他好容易才<BR>
克制住了。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see
any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed
when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with
great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be
to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements
might allow him to visit them.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">他明天一大早就要启程，来不及向大家辞行，<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them
equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.
Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of
paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary
might have been prevailed on to accept him.  She rated his
abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though
by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if
encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as
her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.  But on the
following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.  Miss
Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference
with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">太太小姐们便行礼如仪，辞别回房；大家听说<BR>
他竟打算很快就回来，都感到惊讶。班纳特太<BR>
太满以为他是打算向她的哪一个小女儿求婚，<BR>
也许能劝劝曼丽去应承他。曼丽比任何姐妹都<BR>
看重他的能力。他思想方面的坚定很叫她倾心<BR>
；他虽然比不上她自己那样聪明，可是只要有<BR>
一个象她这样的人作为榜样，鼓励他读书上进<BR>
，那他一定会成为一个称心如意的伴侣。只可<BR>
惜一到第二天早上，这种希望就完全破灭了。<BR>
卢卡斯小姐刚一吃过早饭，就来访问，私下跟<BR>
伊丽莎白把前一天的事说了出来。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with
her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day
or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost
as far from possibility as that she could encourage him
herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to
overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help
crying out,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">早在前一两天，伊丽莎白就一度想到，柯林斯<BR>
先生可能一厢情愿，自以为爱上了她这位朋友<BR>
，可是，要说夏绿蒂会怂恿他，那未免太不可<BR>
能，正如她自己不可能怂恿他一样，因此她现<BR>
在听到这件事，不禁大为惊讶，连礼貌也不顾<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in
telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on
receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than
she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly
replied,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">卢卡斯小姐乍听得这一声心直口快的责备，镇<BR>
静的脸色不禁变得慌张起来，好在这也是她意<BR>

地说：<BR></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? -- Do you think it
incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong
effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness
that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to
her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白这时候已经镇定下来，便竭力克制着<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte, -- "you must
be surprised, very much surprised, -- so lately as Mr. Collins
was wishing to marry you.  But when you have had time to think
it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have
done.  I am not romantic you know.  I never was, I ask only a
comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character,
connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can
boast on entering the marriage state."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">夏绿蒂回答道：“我明白你的心思，你一定会<BR>
感到奇怪，而且感到非常奇怪，因为在不久以<BR>
前，柯林斯先生还在想跟你结婚。可是，只要<BR>
你空下来把这事情细细地想一下，你就会赞成<BR>
我的做法。你知道我不是个罗曼谛克的人，我<BR>
决不是那样的人。我只希望有一个舒舒服服的<BR>
家。论柯林斯先生的性格、社会关系和身份地<BR>
位，我觉得跟他结了婚，也能够获得幸福，并<BR>
不下于一般人结婚时所夸耀的那种幸福。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" -- and after an
awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.
Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left
to reflect on what she had heard.  It was a long time before
she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a
match.  The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of
marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his
being now accepted.  She had always felt that Charlotte's
opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she
could not have supposed it possible that, when called into
action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to
worldly advantage.  Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a
most humiliating picture! -- And to the pang of a friend
disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the
distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend
to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白心平气和地回答道：“毫无问题。”<BR>
她们俩别别扭扭地在一起待了一会儿，便和家<BR>
人一块坐下。夏绿蒂没有过多久就走了；伊丽<BR>
莎白独自把刚才听到的那些话仔细想了一下。<BR>
这样不合适的一门亲事，真使她难受了好久。<BR>
说起柯林斯先生三天之内求了两次婚，本就够<BR>
稀奇了，如今竟会有人应承他，实在是更稀奇<BR>
。她一向觉得，夏绿蒂关于婚姻问题方面的见<BR>
解，跟她颇不一致，却不曾料想到一旦事到临<BR>
头，她竟会完全不顾高尚的情操，来屈就一些<BR>
世俗的利益。夏绿蒂做了柯林斯的妻子，巡真<BR>
是天下最丢人的事！她不仅为这样一个朋友的<BR>
自取其辱、自贬身份而感到难受，而且她还十<BR>
分痛心地断定，她朋友拈的这一个阄儿，决不<BR>
会给她自己带来多大的幸福。<BR></TD>
