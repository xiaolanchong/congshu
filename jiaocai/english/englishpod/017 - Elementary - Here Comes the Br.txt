Look here come the bridesmaids!        Their dresses look beautiful!  B:    Who are those kids walking down the aisle?  A:    That’s  the  ﬂower  girl  and  the  ring      bearer.     I’m        pretty sure they’re the groom’s niece and nephew.        Oh, they look so cute!  B:    I just hope the priest makes it quick.
