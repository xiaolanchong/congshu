<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with
Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family
were sitting together in the dining room, their attention
was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage;
and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.
The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery
of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.  As it
was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley
instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of
such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was
thrown open and their visitor entered.  It was Lady Catherine
de Bourgh.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">有一天上午，大约是彬格莱和吉英订婚之后的<BR>
一个星期，彬格莱正和女眷们坐在饭厅里，忽<BR>
然听到一阵马车声，大家都走到窗口去看，只<BR>
见一辆四马大轿车驶进园里来。这么一大早，<BR>
理当不会有客人来，再看看那辆马车的配备，<BR>
便知道这位访客决不是他们的街坊四邻。马是<BR>
驿站上的马，至于马车本身，车前待从所穿的<BR>
号服，他们也不熟悉。彬格莱既然断定有人来<BR>
访，便马上劝班纳特小姐跟他避开，免得被这<BR>
不速之客缠住，于是吉英跟他走到矮树林里去<BR>
了。他们俩走了以后，另外三个人依旧在那儿<BR>
猜测，可惜猜不出这位来客是谁。最后门开了<BR>
，客人走进屋来，原来是咖苔琳・德・包尔夫<BR>
人。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of
Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to
them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">大家当然都十分诧异，万万想不到会有这样出<BR>
奇的事。班纳特太太和吉蒂跟她素昧生平，可<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,
made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight
inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her
ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been
made.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">客人走进屋来的那副神气非常没有礼貌。伊丽<BR>
莎白招呼她，她只稍微侧了一下头，便一屁股<BR>
坐下来，一句话也不说。她走进来的时候，虽<BR>
然没有要求人家介绍，伊丽莎白还是把她的名<BR>
字告诉了她母亲。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a
guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost
politeness.  After sitting for a moment in silence, she said
very stiffly to Elizabeth,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太大为惊异，不过，这样一位了不起<BR>

此她便极其有礼貌地加以招待。咖苔琳夫人不<BR>

is your mother."

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白简简单单地回答了一声正是。<BR></TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"And that I suppose is one of your sisters."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“那一位大概就是你妹妹吧？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady
Catherine.  "She is my youngest girl but one.  My youngest of
all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the
grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon
become a part of the family."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太连忙应声回答：“正是，夫人，”<BR>
她能够跟这样一位贵夫人攀谈，真是得意。“<BR>
这是我第四个女儿。我最小的一个女儿最近出<BR>

个小伙子不久也要变成我们自己人了。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine
after a short silence.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">咖苔琳夫人没有理睬她，过了片刻才说：“你<BR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say;
but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“哪能比得上罗新斯，夫人，可是我敢说，比<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,
in summer; the windows are full west."

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,
and then added,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太告诉她说，她们每天吃过中饭以后<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you
left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我是否可以冒昧请问你夫人一声，柯林斯夫<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, very well.  I saw them the night before last."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他们都很好，前天晚上我还看见他们的。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for
her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for
her calling.  But no letter appeared, and she was completely
puzzled.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">这时伊丽莎白满以为她会拿出一封夏绿蒂的信<BR>
来；她认为咖苔琳夫人这次到这里来，决不可<BR>
能为了别的原因。可是并不见夫人拿信出来，<BR>
这真叫她完全不明白是怎么回事了。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take
some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not
very politely, declined eating any thing; and then, rising up,
said to Elizabeth,
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">班纳特太太恭恭敬敬地请贵夫人随意用些点心<BR>
，可是咖苔琳夫人什么也不肯吃，谢绝非常坚<BR>
决，非常没有礼貌，接着又站起来跟伊丽莎白<BR>
说：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little
wilderness on one side of your lawn.  I should be glad to take
a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“班纳特小姐，你们这块草地的那一头，好象<BR>
颇有几分荒野的景色，倒很好看。我很想到那<BR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and show her ladyship about
the different walks.  I think she will be pleased with the
hermitage."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">只听得她母亲连忙大声对她说：“你去吧，乖<BR>
孩子，陪着夫人到各条小径上去逛逛。我想，<BR>
她一定会喜欢我们这个幽静的小地方。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her
parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.  As they passed
through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the
dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a
short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白听从了母亲的话，先到自己房间里去<BR>
拿了一把阳伞，然后下楼来待候这位贵客。两<BR>
人走过穿堂，咖苔琳夫人打开了那扇通到饭厅<BR>
和客厅的门，稍稍打量了一下，说是这屋子还<BR>
算过得去，然后继续向前走。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it.  They proceeded in silence along the
gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to
make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more
than usually insolent and disagreeable.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她的马车停在门口，伊丽莎白看见了车子里面<BR>
坐着她的待女。两人默默无声地沿着一条通到<BR>
小树林的鹅卵石铺道往前走。伊丽莎白只觉得<BR>
这个老妇人比往常更傲慢，更其令人讨厌，因<BR>
此拿定主张，决不先开口跟她说话。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she
looked in her face.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">她仔细瞧了一下老妇人的脸，不禁想道：“她<BR>
哪一点地方象她姨侄？”<BR></TD>

following manner: --
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">一走进小树林，咖苔琳夫人便用这样的方式跟<BR>
她谈话：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason
of my journey hither.  Your own heart, your own conscience,
must tell you why I come."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“班纳特小姐，我这次上这儿来，你一定知道<BR>
我是为了什么原因。你心里一定有数，你的良<BR>
心一定会告诉你，我这次为什么要来。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白大为惊讶。<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.  I have not been at all able
to account for the honour of seeing you here."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“夫人，你实在想错了，我完全不明白你这次<BR>
怎么这样看得起我们，会到这种地方来。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you
ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.  But however
insincere <I>you</I> may choose to be, you shall not find <I>me</I> so.
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and
frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall
certainly not depart from it.  A report of a most alarming
nature reached me two days ago.  I was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married,
but that <I>you</I>, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all
likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own
nephew, Mr. Darcy.  Though I <I>know</I> it must be a scandalous
falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose
the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off
for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">夫人一听此话，很是生气：“班纳特小姐，你<BR>
要知道，我是决不肯让人家来跟我开玩笑的。<BR>
尽管你怎样不老实，我可不是那样。我是个有<BR>
名的老实坦白的人，何况遇到现在这桩事，我<BR>
当然更要老实坦白。两天以前，我听到一个极<BR>
其惊人的消息。我听说不光是你姐姐将要攀上<BR>
一门高亲，连你，伊丽莎白・班纳特小姐，也<BR>
快要攀上我的姨侄，我的亲姨侄达西先生。虽<BR>
然我明知这是无稽的流言，虽然我不会那样看<BR>
不起他，相信他真会有这种事情，我还是当机<BR>
立断，决定上这儿来一次，把我的意思说给你<BR>
听。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth,
colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the
trouble of coming so far.  What could your ladyship propose by
it?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白又是诧异，又是厌恶，满脸涨得通红<BR>
。“我真奇怪，你既然认为不会有这种事情，<BR>
何必还要自找麻烦，跑到这么远的地方来？请<BR>
问你老人家究竟有何见教？”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"At once to insist upon having such a report universally
contradicted."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我一定要你立刻向大家去辟谣。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said
Elizabeth coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if,
indeed, such a report is in existence."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">伊丽莎白冷冷地说：“要是外界真有这种传说<BR>

会弄假成真。”<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"If!  Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?  Has it not
been industriously circulated by yourselves?  Do you not know
that such a report is spread abroad?"

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“要是真有这种传说！你难道存心要假痴假呆<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"I never heard that it was."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我从来没有听见过。”<BR></TD>

<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“你能不能说一声这是毫无根据？”<BR></TD>

<TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.  From their
infancy, they have been intended for each other.  It was the
favourite wish of <I>his</I> mother, as well as of her's.  While in
their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment
when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their
marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth,
of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the
family!  Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?  Are you lost to
every feeling of propriety and delicacy?  Have you not heard
me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his
cousin?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“他们的订婚，跟一般情形两样。他们从小就<BR>

达到，却忽然来了个出身卑贱、门户低微的小<BR>
妮子从中作梗，何况这个小妮子跟他家里非亲<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Yes, and I had heard it before.  But what is that to me?  If
there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall
certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and
aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.  You both did as much
as you could in planning the marriage.  Its completion depended
on others.  If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination
confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">“我以前确实听到过。可是我管它做什么？如<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed
by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the
inclinations of all.  You will be censured, slighted, and
despised, by every one connected with him.  Your alliance will
be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any
