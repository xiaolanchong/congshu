next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single
line from him.  His family knew him to be, on all common
occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but
at such a time they had hoped for exertion.  They were forced
to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send,
but even of <I>that</I> they would have been glad to be certain.
Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be
serviceable to her nieces.  She shared in their attendance on
Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of
freedom.  Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and
always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening
them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh
instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom
went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.

months before, had been almost an angel of light.  He was
declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his
intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been
extended into every tradesman's family.  Every body declared
that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every
body began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness.  Elizabeth, though she did not
credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her
former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and
even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost
hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if
they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely
despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.

received a letter from him; it told them that on his arrival,
he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to
come to Gracechurch street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom
and Clapham before his arrival, but without gaining any
satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to
enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on
their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.
Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this
measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist
him in pursuing it.  He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly
disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write
again very soon.  There was also a postscript to this effect:

to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">长者先生赐鉴：<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">I feel myself called upon by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are
now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a
letter from Hertfordshire.  Be assured, my dear Sir, that
Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all
your respectable family, in your present distress, which must
be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which
no time can remove.  No arguments shall be wanting on my part
that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort
you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most
afflicting to a parent's mind.  The death of your daughter
would have been a blessing in comparison of this.  And it is
the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as
my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of
behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree
of indulgence, though at the same time, for the consolation of
yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own
disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty
of such an enormity at so early an age.  Howsoever that may be,
you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only
joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her
daughter, to whom I have related the affair.  They agree with
me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be
injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady
Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
with such a family.  And this consideration leads me moreover
to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of
last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been
involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.  Let me advise you
then, my dear Sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to
throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and
leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="40%">Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer
from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant
nature to send.  It was not known that Wickham had a single
relation with whom he kept up any connection, and it was
certain that he had no near one living.  His former
acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular
friendship with any of them.  There was no one therefore who
could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.  And in
the wretched state of his own finances there was a very
powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of
discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that
he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount.  Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand
pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.
He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were
still more formidable.  Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal
these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them
with horror.  "A gamester!" she cried.  "This is wholly
unexpected.  I had not an idea of it."
<BR></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%" LANG="zh">嘉丁纳先生一直挨到接得弗斯脱上校的回信以<BR>

有一个至亲在世。他以前交游颇广，只是自从<BR>
进了民兵团以后，看来跟他们都已疏远，因此<BR>
找不出一个人来可以报道一些有关他的消息。<BR>
他这次所以要保守秘密，据说是因为他临走时<BR>
拖欠了一大笔赌债，而他目前手头又非常拮据<BR>
，无法偿还，再则是因为怕让丽迪雅的亲友发<BR>
觉。弗斯脱上校认为，要清偿他在白利屯的债<BR>
务，需要不一千多英镑才够。他在本镇固然欠<BR>
债很多，但赌债则更可观。嘉丁纳先生并打算<BR>

see their father at home on the following day, which was
Saturday.  Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their
endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty
that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do
whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing
their pursuit.  When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not
